### Quick Report

Intel has rubbished reports of CPU recall due to degraded silicon causing instability on many apps and games which will be fixed next month with microcode updates. Many users were dumbfounded what to do with their CPUs which is not stable even with underclocks and crashing with day to day applications. But, Intel is asking affected users to get in touch with their support team for RMA and Intel will do CPU replacements as per warranty.

It is unsure how Intel will handle OEM CPU replacements which only cover a year of warranty for entire assembled PCs even after reports of CPUs affected included 65W parts which are not overclockable and users are frustrated how to find they are affected by this issue unless they run into out of memory issues, random crashes, and other issues.

I did cover the microcode issue in my earlier posts.
