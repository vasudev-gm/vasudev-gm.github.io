Razer is targeting AI developers and power users who want to avoid cloud fees and keep data local. The launch also includes AIKit, an open-source toolkit compatible with over 280,000 LLMs, and a partnership with Tenstorrent for portable Thunderbolt AI accelerators. The Forge can be rack-mounted for teams or used as a standalone tower, offering scalable local compute for demanding AI workloads.
