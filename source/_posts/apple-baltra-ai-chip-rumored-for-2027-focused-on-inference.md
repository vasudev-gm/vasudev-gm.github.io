### Quick Report

Apple is rumored to launch its in-house \"Baltra\" AI chip in 2027, targeting inference workloads in data centers. The chip is expected to be built on TSMC\'s 3 nm process and designed for efficiency and cost-effectiveness, rather than raw training power.<!-- more -->

Industry sources suggest Baltra will power Apple\'s Private Cloud Compute and next-gen Siri, possibly using clusters of up to 64 chips with high-bandwidth LPDDR memory. The chip is not intended for massive AI training but for running inference tasks at scale. Apple is also reportedly partnering with Google for Gemini-powered LLMs to enhance AI features across its ecosystem.
