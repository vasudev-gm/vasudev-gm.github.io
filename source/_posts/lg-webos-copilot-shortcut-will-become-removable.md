### Quick Report

LG says the Microsoft Copilot entry that appeared on some webOS TVs is a shortcut icon that opens Copilot in the TV\'s web browser, not a built-in app or service. LG also says a future update will add an option to remove the Copilot shortcut, although there is no date yet.<!-- more -->

The clarification follows a wave of complaints after users reported they could not delete the Copilot item. In LG\'s statement, the company describes the shortcut as a convenience feature and adds that microphone input is activated only with the customer\'s explicit consent.

If you are trying to evaluate the privacy impact, the practical difference is that removing a shortcut and disabling a deeply integrated on-device feature are not the same thing. However, the ability to delete the icon should still reduce unwanted surface area in the UI for people who simply do not want Copilot visible.
