### Quick Report

Thermal Grizzly has officially launched the der8enchtable, a premium benchtable developed in collaboration with renowned overclocking experts Roman "der8auer" Hartung and Jon "elmor" Sandström. Priced at $268.98, this professional testing platform stands out from conventional benchtables by featuring an integrated active PCB with comprehensive connectivity options and fan control capabilities, making it an ideal solution for hardware enthusiasts, reviewers, and overclockers.

What sets the der8enchtable apart from standard test benches is its sophisticated integrated PCB that serves as a command center for hardware testing. The platform offers three dedicated fan control zones, each featuring three 4-pin headers that can be independently switched between 50% and 100% speed settings. Each zone provides 3A of power and includes protective fusing to prevent damage from power surges. Additionally, a separate pump zone with two 4-pin headers delivers up to 6A total (3A per port) for connecting AIO cooling solutions.

The benchtable\'s comprehensive connectivity options include four USB 2.0 Type-A ports (500mA each) and two USB 2.0 Type-C ports (3A each), allowing users to connect peripherals directly to the bench. For storage needs, the der8enchtable offers multiple options including two onboard SATA connectors, two SATA output connectors, and four microSD card slots — a particularly useful feature for testers who need to quickly switch between different operating systems or testing environments.

Built with versatility in mind, the der8enchtable features a modular, black-anodized aluminum frame design that can be configured to accommodate different motherboard form factors including ATX, Micro-ATX, and Mini-ITX. The lower section houses a power supply mount with a custom-cuttable Velcro strap for cable management. For users who prefer a more compact setup, the feet can be attached directly to the base unit, eliminating the need for the lower frame section.

The system is powered via a PCIe 6-pin cable from the PSU and connects to the test motherboard through a standard 9-pin USB header. Additional features include dedicated power and reset buttons, addressable RGB lighting (aRGB) with a 3-pin header for connection to the motherboard or an external controller, and support for both air and liquid cooling solutions.

The der8enchtable represents Thermal Grizzly\'s continued expansion beyond thermal compounds into the broader hardware testing market, providing professional-grade tools for the enthusiast community. Its comprehensive feature set and thoughtful design reflect the practical experience of its creators, der8auer and elmor, both highly respected figures in the overclocking community.
