### Quick Report

A major blind test conducted by ComputerBase found that gamers overwhelmingly prefer the image quality of NVIDIA\'s DLSS 4.5 over both native resolution rendering and AMD\'s FSR 4. The test covered several popular games and used unlabeled video comparisons to ensure unbiased results.

DLSS 4.5, powered by a second-generation Transformer model and FP8 data format, consistently won in every scenario except for a near-tie in Cyberpunk 2077. AMD\'s latest FSR 4, while providing a solid FPS boost, was less favored for visual quality. The results highlight NVIDIA\'s lead in AI upscaling, though all three methods have their supporters and use cases.
