### Quick Report

Apple has decided to transition to newer 5G Mediatek from Intel modems in their future Apple Watch models. This decision is expected to provide better connectivity and performance for users.

Current Apple Watches are limited to 4G connectivity and do not support latest 5G connectivity. Mediatek modems support a feature called 5G Recap that allows for lower than standard 5G speeds but optimized for power consumption for always connected smart devices and wearables.

Mediatek has leveraged TSMC\'s design process to optimize their modems and compete with Qualcomm after the launch of Dimensity 9400 and completely decimates Intel modem in terms of raw performance and power efficiency. Better power consumption will increase battery life and allow for longer usage times. There are rumors that iPhone SE 4 will be the first iPhone with in-house modem to leverage Apple\'s tight vertical integration and reduce reliance on Qualcomm modems.
