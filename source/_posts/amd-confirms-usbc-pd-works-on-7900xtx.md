### Quick Report

AMD has officially confirmed that USB-C Power Delivery (PD) works as expected on the Radeon RX 7900 XTX graphics card. Independent testing shows the card can deliver up to 27W of charging power to compatible devices, such as VR headsets and smartphones, via its USB-C port. This dispels earlier rumors of PD issues and reassures users about accessory compatibility.

AMD confirms the RX 7900 XTX\'s USB-C port supports up to 27W Power Delivery, and independent testing shows the card can charge VR headsets, phones, and other USB-C accessories. The PD functionality works out of the box with no firmware or driver update required, although AMD recommends using certified USB-C cables for the best results.

This is important because it ensures reliable charging and connectivity for modern peripherals, resolves confusion from earlier reports that suggested PD might not work, and makes the RX 7900 XTX a more attractive option for VR and creator setups.

For users, the practical guidance is simple: use high-quality, certified USB-C cables, verify that your device accepts 27W PD output, and take no additional action if you already own a 7900 XTXâ€”Power Delivery should function as shipped.
