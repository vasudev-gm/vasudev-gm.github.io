### Quick Report

Intel\'s CFO David Zinsner has confirmed that the company\'s upcoming 14A (1.4nm-class) manufacturing process will be more expensive to use than its 18A process node. Speaking at Citi\'s 2025 Global TMT Conference, Zinsner attributed the higher costs primarily to the use of ASML\'s next-generation Twinscan EXE:5200B High-NA EUV lithography machines, which feature advanced 0.55 numerical aperture optics.

14A is more expensive than 18A, Zinsner stated during the conference. "It is not significantly [more expensive] in terms of investment. But, it is a higher wafer cost, for sure, and partly that is because we are expecting to use High-NA EUV tools in 14A, which was not the case in 18A."

Despite the increased manufacturing costs, the 14A process is expected to deliver substantial performance benefits. Intel projects that the node will offer either 15-20% better performance-per-watt or 25-35% lower power consumption compared to 18A, giving chip designers flexibility to prioritize either performance or efficiency.

The 14A process represents a significant milestone for Intel as it\'s the company\'s first fabrication technology designed from the ground up for both Intel\'s internal use and its foundry customers. This dual-purpose approach aligns with Intel\'s strategic pivot toward becoming a major player in the contract chip manufacturing business.

High-NA EUV lithography is considered the next critical advancement in semiconductor manufacturing, enabling finer circuit patterns and greater transistor density than current EUV systems. However, these cutting-edge tools come at a premium price, with each machine reportedly costing over $300 million, significantly more than standard EUV systems.

This development comes amid Intel\'s ongoing efforts to regain technology leadership in semiconductor manufacturing after falling behind competitors like TSMC in recent years. The company has been investing heavily in advanced process technologies as part of CEO Pat Gelsinger\'s IDM 2.0 strategy, which emphasizes both internal manufacturing capabilities and foundry services.

The timeline for 14A production remains on track according to Intel\'s roadmap, with initial manufacturing expected to begin after the rollout of 18A, which is slated for late 2025 or early 2026.
