### Quick Report

Boutique system builders like Paradox Customs and MAINGEAR have started selling prebuilt gaming PCs without any memory installed, a response to the ongoing DRAM shortage and steep DDR5 price hikes.

This new approach lets buyers save upfront or use their own RAM, but it also means customers must handle compatibility and setup themselves. Traditionally, integrators validated and tuned memory for stability, but now the risk of boot issues or performance loss falls on the end user. With 32 GB DDR5 kits now costing around $400, this trend could expand if shortages persist, blurring the line between prebuilt and DIY systems.
