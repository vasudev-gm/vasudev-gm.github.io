### Quick Report

AMD has unveiled its latest ML based super resolution algorithm dubbed FSR4: Project Redstone, at Computex 2025. This new iteration promises to deliver significant performance improvements and enhanced visual fidelity for gamers. FSR4 is designed to work seamlessly across a wide range of hardware, including both AMD and NVIDIA GPUs, making it a versatile solution for the gaming community.

It brings new features such as Neural Radiance Caching, AI based Ray Re-Generation and Frame Generation algorithms, which are expected to enhance the gaming experience by providing higher frame rates and improved image quality. The technology is set to be available in a variety of upcoming games, with AMD showcasing its capabilities through live demos at the event. With these features AMD aims to compete with DLSS and XeSS, offering gamers a robust alternative that leverages machine learning to push the boundaries of gaming graphics.

With Neural Radiance Caching, the AI model continues to learn how light bounces and interacts within scene to predict and store indirect lighting thereby reducing performance cost of ray tracing. AI based Ray Re-Generation will allow the GPU to re-generate pixels that cannot be path-traced accurately with the help of neural network model. Frame Generation algorithms will incorporate spatial and temporal awareness to further boost frame rates by generating intermediate frames, providing a smoother gaming experience with the help of ML models.

Currently, AMD has said 60 titles will support FSR4 with more to follow and integration should be easy for developers who already have FSR3.1 and above in their games.
