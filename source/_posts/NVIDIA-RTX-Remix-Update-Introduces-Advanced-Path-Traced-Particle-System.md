### Quick Report

NVIDIA has released version 1.2.4 of RTX Remix, introducing an advanced path-traced particle system that enables modders to dramatically enhance visual effects in classic PC games. This update allows creators to replace decades-old particle effects with modern, physically accurate alternatives that can cast realistic light and shadows while interacting properly with the game environment. The new system is GPU-accelerated, making it possible to render tens of thousands of particles without significant performance impact.

The addition of path-traced particles represents a significant enhancement to NVIDIA\'s modding platform, which already allows creators to upgrade classic games with modern ray-traced lighting and improved textures. This technology enables particles to cast accurate shadows and appear in reflectionsâ€”capabilities rarely seen even in modern games. The new particle effects feature realistic physics simulation with proper environmental collisions, creating more immersive and visually impressive scenes.

According to NVIDIA, adding RTX Remix particles is designed to be accessible even for casual modders. Users can apply particle effects while playing through the Alt+X developer menu, selecting any game element and designating it as a particle emitter. From there, they can adjust parameters such as size, spawn rate, color, and other attributes to achieve their desired look. For more advanced customization, the RTX Remix Toolkit offers additional control options.

The update showcases impressive examples from Half-Life 2 RTX and Portal with RTX, demonstrating how the technology can transform simple fire effects into realistic flames with billowing smoke and floating embers. In one particularly striking demonstration, NVIDIA assigned the Antlion Guard from Half-Life 2 RTX as a particle emitter, rendering over 100,000 shadowed particles that accurately respond to the creature\'s movements.

Since its initial release, the RTX Remix modding community has grown to include 237 active projects across beloved titles like Half-Life 2, Need for Speed Underground, Portal 2, and Deus Ex. Over 100 RTX Remix mods have already been released, accumulating more than 2 million downloads collectively. The platform\'s recent mod contest awarded $60,000 in prizes to outstanding projects including Painkiller RTX Remix, Vampire The Masquerade: Bloodlines - RTX Remaster, I-Ninja Remixed, and Call of Duty 2 RTX Remix of Carentan.
