### Quick Report

PC builders are facing imminent price hikes for power supplies and CPU coolers, with costs expected to rise by 6-10% in the coming weeks. The increases are driven by surging prices for raw materials like copper and silver, which are critical for manufacturing these components. Suppliers in China have advised customers to secure inventory before discounts end in February, warning that most products will soon be sold at full price.

The global expansion of AI data centers has intensified demand for copper wiring, while silver\'s scarcity and industrial use have further pushed up costs. Although the initial hike is projected at 6-10%, ongoing supply chain adjustments could lead to even higher prices. Consumers should monitor the market closely, as these changes may impact PC build budgets throughout 2026.
