### Quick Report

NVIDIA is planning to release its GeForce RTX 50-series SUPER graphics cards by Christmas 2025, focusing primarily on increased memory capacities using new 24Gb GDDR7 dense memory chips rather than significant performance core improvements.

<!-- more -->

- RTX 50 SUPER series targeted for Christmas 2025 release
- Focus on memory upgrades: RTX 5070 SUPER gets 18GB, RTX 5070 Ti and 5080 SUPER get 24GB
- Only RTX 5070 SUPER receives additional cores (maxing out GB205 silicon at 6,400 CUDA cores)
- New 24 Gbit GDDR7 memory enables larger capacities on existing bus widths
- Marginal clock speed increases and higher TGP (Total Graphics Power) across the lineup

NVIDIA appears to be taking a conservative approach with the SUPER refresh, prioritizing memory capacity improvements over architectural changes to address gaming demands at higher resolutions with ray tracing enabled.
