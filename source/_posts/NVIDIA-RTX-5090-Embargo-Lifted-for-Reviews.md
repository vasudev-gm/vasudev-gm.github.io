### Quick Report

Nvidia has lifted the review embargo for the RTX 5090. In general you can notice up to 30% improvement in heavy ray tracing and better DLSS transformer model quality and performance. Current owners of 4090 can skip it if efficiency is utmost importance rather than brute force power and performance.

I will link some of the videos and articles below which I personally watched to get overall idea of RTX 5090 performance and power efficiency.
