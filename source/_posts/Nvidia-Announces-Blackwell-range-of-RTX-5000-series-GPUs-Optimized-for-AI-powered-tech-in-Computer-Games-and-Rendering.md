The blackwell lineup includes the RTX 5090, RTX 5080, RTX 5070 Ti and RTX 5070 powered with GDDR7 memory. The RTX 5090 is the flagship model with 32GB of GDDR7 memory and 3.3 AI TOPS (FP4). The RTX 5080 and RTX 5070 Ti are powered with 16GB of GDDR7 memory while RTX 5070 features 12GB of GDDR7 memory.

NVIDIA also announced [DLSS 4][def2] which debuts Multi Frame Generation using AI to generate up to three frames per rendered frame for improved FPS which works best for High Refresh Rate Display. DLSS 3.5 is also introduced which uses AI to improve the quality of the final image. Neural Texture and Neural Rendering are also introduced which use AI to improve the quality of textures and lighting in real-time taking less memory.

[NVIDIA Reflex 2][def] introduces Frame Warp, an innovative technology that reduces latency by up to 75% and is available on all GeForce RTX 50 Series GPUs to give gamers an edge in competitive gaming.

NVIDIA also announced the pricing of RTX 5000 series with 5090 costing USD 1999, 5080 at USD 999, 5070 Ti at USD 749 and 5070 at USD 549.
