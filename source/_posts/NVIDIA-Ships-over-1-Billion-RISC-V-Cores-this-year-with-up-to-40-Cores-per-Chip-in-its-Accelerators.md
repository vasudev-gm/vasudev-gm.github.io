### Quick Report

During the 2024 RISC-V Summit in Santa Clara, California, NVIDIA was one of the presenting members. RISC-V, a free and open-source ISA (Instruction Set Architecture) making an interesting choice for many companies who wants to develop custom cores. NVIDIA developed their custom RISC-V core called **NV-RISCV** which replaced its predecessor **Falcon**.
<!-- more -->

NV-RISCV is much more customized caches and special instructions such as chip-to-chip interfaces, context switching, memory controller, camera handling, video codecs, display output, resource management, power management, and more. NVIDIA has developed over 20+ custom extensions for RISC-V cores, which all caters to their specific use cases.
