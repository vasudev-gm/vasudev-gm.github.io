### Quick Report

AMD launched the Ryzen 7 9850X3D, an 8-core/16-thread Zen 5 desktop CPU with third-gen 3D V-Cache. It keeps a 4.70 GHz base clock but increases maximum boost to 5.60 GHz (up from 5.20 GHz on 9800X3D), alongside a 120 W TDP. The latest 3D V-Cache places the 64 MB L3D under the CCD, improving thermal behavior and helping sustain higher boosts and overclocking. Retail availability begins in Q1 2026; pricing wasn\'t disclosed.

AMD\'s messaging emphasizes better boost residency across thread counts and improved OC headroom due to the under-CCD L3D placement. The 9850X3D targets top-tier gaming performance while retaining the platform\'s efficiency advantages of Zen 5 and X3D stacking.
