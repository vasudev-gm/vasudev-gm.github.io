### Quick Report

A Firefox developer posting from the official Firefox for Web Developers Mastodon account says Mozilla plans a browser-wide option to completely disable all AI features. The message describes an internal \"AI kill switch\" concept that would remove AI functionality and keep it from reappearing unless re-enabled manually.<!-- more -->

The clarification follows user backlash after Mozilla discussed steering Firefox toward an \"AI browser\" direction. In the post, the developer also says AI features will be opt-in, while acknowledging that \"opt-in\" can be interpreted differently (for example, whether a new toolbar button counts).

A global off switch is a meaningful commitment if implemented cleanly, because it sets a stronger expectation than scattered per-feature toggles. The key detail to watch will be scope: whether the switch covers all AI-related UI and services, including anything that might otherwise ship enabled by default.
