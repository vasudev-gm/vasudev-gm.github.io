### Quick Report

Finally Intel caved in after falling [stock price][def] and a lot of negative press with failing CPUs and instability issues on consumer CPUs. Intel officially announced in a statement to [Tom\'s Hardware][def3] that, it will be extending warranty for all Intel consumers or customers with 13th and 14 gen CPUs affected by the instability issues that could be caused due to oxidation and faulty microcode that delivers more power than requested by CPU which slowly degraded and caused unexpected crashes.

Intel is **now stressing the point** that, they value customer trust and warranty extension is a way to show we are proactive about the situation and they are here to help and urged to contact OEM vendors for further assistance if customers pre-built systems are affected.

Here is the excerpts from the statement:
> Intel is committed to making sure all customers who have or are currently experiencing instability symptoms on their 13th and/or 14th Gen desktop processors are supported in the exchange process. We stand behind our products, and in the coming days we will be sharing more details on two-year extended warranty support for our boxed Intel Core 13th and 14th Gen desktop processors.
>>In the meantime, if you are currently or previously experienced instability symptoms on your Intel Core 13th/14th Gen desktop system:
  >>> For users who purchased systems from OEM/System Integrators - please reach out to your system manufacturer\'s support team for further assistance.
  >>> For users who purchased a boxed CPU - please reach out to Intel Customer Support for further assistance.
Intel is also investigating options to easily identify affected processors on end user systems and will provide additional guidance as soon as possible. At the same time, we apologize for the delay in communications as this has been a challenging issue to unravel and definitively root cause.
The Via Oxidation issue currently reported in the press is a minor one that was addressed with manufacturing improvements and screens in early 2023.

>The issue was identified in late 2022, and with the manufacturing improvements and additional screens implemented Intel was able to confirm full removal of impacted processors in our supply chain by early 2024. However, on-shelf inventory may have persisted into early 2024 as a result.
Minor manufacturing issues are an inescapable fact with all silicon products. Intel continuously works with customers to troubleshoot and remediate product failure reports and provides public communications on product issues when the customer risk exceeds Intel quality control thresholds.
