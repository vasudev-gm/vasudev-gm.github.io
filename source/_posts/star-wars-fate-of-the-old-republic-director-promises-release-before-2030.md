The game was unveiled at The Game Awards, surprising fans with its announcement and teaser trailer. While some industry insiders remain skeptical about the timeline, Hudson emphasized that development is underway and the team is aiming for a release well ahead of 2030. The project is not a direct continuation of KOTOR/SWTOR lore but is set in the High Republic era, focusing on a single-player experience.
