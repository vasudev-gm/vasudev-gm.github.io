### Quick Report

As desktop DRAM prices have skyrocketed with a 245% year-over-year increase, more users are turning to SODIMM-to-DIMM adapters to repurpose cheaper laptop memory for desktop builds. Laptop SODIMMs have seen a smaller 136% price hike, making them more affordable. Adapters cost between €3 and €18, and while they result in reduced speeds and looser timings, they offer a cost-effective solution for system upgrades.

SODIMM-to-DIMM adapters enable the use of laptop SODIMMs in desktop motherboards, providing a workaround for high memory costs. For instance, a 16 GB DDR5-4800 SODIMM costs around €100, compared to €146 for a similar desktop DIMM. However, users should expect lower performance and potential stability issues due to the adapter\'s signal path.
