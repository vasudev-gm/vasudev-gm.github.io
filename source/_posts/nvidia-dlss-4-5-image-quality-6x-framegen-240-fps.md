### Quick Report

NVIDIA announced DLSS 4.5 with a second‑generation Transformer upscaler trained on a larger dataset, delivering higher detail and reduced ghosting across presets. On RTX 50 **Blackwell** GPUs, DLSS 4.5 adds 6× Multi Frame Generation and Dynamic MFG to auto‑adjust framegen rates, targeting consistent FPS and lower latency; top cards aim for 4K path‑traced gaming at 240 Hz.

The 2nd‑gen Transformer leverages FP8 on Ada and Blackwell Tensor cores; Ampere and Turing remain supported without FP8 acceleration, seeing visual gains but smaller performance uplift. Availability starts with Super Resolution today across 400+ games, while 6× MFG and Dynamic MFG roll out in Spring 2026, configurable via the NVIDIA App.
