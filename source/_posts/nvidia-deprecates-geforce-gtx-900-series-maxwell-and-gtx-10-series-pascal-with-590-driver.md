### Quick Report

NVIDIA has deprecated the GeForce GTX 900 series (Maxwell) and GTX 10 series (Pascal) GPUs with the release of driver version 590. This marks the end of active support for these popular architectures, which have served gamers for nearly a decade.

The deprecation means these GPUs will no longer receive game-ready driver updates, performance optimizations, or new features. However, critical security updates may still be provided. The GTX 900 and GTX 10 series were widely adopted and remain in use by millions of gamers worldwide. NVIDIA\'s decision reflects the natural lifecycle of GPU support as the company focuses resources on newer architectures like Turing, Ampere, Ada Lovelace, and Blackwell.
