### Quick Report

Intel has announced it will drop support for 16x MSAA (Multi-Sample Anti-Aliasing) with its upcoming Xe3 **Celestial** graphics architecture. While the architecture will continue to support MSAA at 2x, 4x, and 8x levels, the company cites modern upscaling technologies like XeSS and TAA as superior alternatives that make the legacy 16x MSAA obsolete for most use cases.

Intel\'s decision to maintain support for 2x, 4x, and 8x MSAA levels should ensure compatibility with older gaming titles and 3D productivity applications that don\'t implement newer anti-aliasing techniques. This partial support represents a compromise between embracing new technologies while maintaining compatibility with legacy software.
