### Quick Report

NVIDIA has pulled its GeForce 595.59 WHQL Game Ready driver from the downloads page after widespread user reports of stability issues. The most common bug involves GPU fan detection, with only one fan working, and some users also reported clock stability problems. The driver was intended to optimize Resident Evil Requiem and Marathon, but quickly drew complaints on NVIDIA\'s GeForce Forums.

NVIDIA has advised affected users to roll back to the previous stable 591.86 WHQL driver. The company is investigating the bug and has temporarily removed the 595.59 download. TechPowerUp has also removed the broken driver from its download section, but older stable versions remain available for those who need them.
