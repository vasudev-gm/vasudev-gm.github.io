### Quick Report

AMD has stated that its upcoming Ryzen 7 9850X3D CPU shows less than a 1% FPS difference when using DDR5-6000 compared to DDR5-4800 memory. This means gamers can opt for more affordable DDR5-4800 kits without sacrificing real-world gaming performance.

The claim, based on AMD\'s internal testing, highlights that spending 17.5% more for faster memory yields no significant benefit for this 8-core Zen 5 chip with 3D V-Cache. The 9850X3D launches January 29 at $499, offering a 400 MHz boost over its predecessor. Reviewers are expected to further scrutinize these results after launch.
