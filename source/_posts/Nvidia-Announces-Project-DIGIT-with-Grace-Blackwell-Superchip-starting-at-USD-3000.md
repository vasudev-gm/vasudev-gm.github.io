With this compute power, it can train 200 Billion paramater models and can even run 400+ Billion parameter models with help of Nvidia [ConnectX][def4] networking to link another DIGITS. It is powered by in-house DGX OS, a nvidia optimized Linux distribution which can be easily deployed to Nvidia DGX cloud or accelerated cloud instances or even datacenter infrastructures.

Developers can fine-tune models using Project [NeMo][def] framework, accelerate data science with RAPIDS library and run NumPy, TensorFlow, PyTorch, and JAX on the DIGIT.
