### Quick Report

NVIDIA is reportedly preparing to launch its long-awaited ARM-based laptop processors in the first half of 2026. These SoCs integrate CPU, GPU, and NPU into a single package, focusing on thin-and-light designs with enhanced efficiency and battery life. Systems from OEMs like Dell and Lenovo could ship within months of launch, with internal names including N1 and N1X based on the GB10 Superchip architecture.

NVIDIA is reportedly preparing its long-awaited new consumer laptop processor for launch in the first half of 2026, according to a report from The Wall Street Journal. The chip uses a system-on-chip approach integrating CPU, GPU, and NPU into a single package. Systems based on those chips could first ship from OEMs such as Dell and Lenovo within months of launch, though no products have been confirmed. These systems are expected to focus on thin-and-light designs with an emphasis on efficiency and battery life.

The report says NVIDIA is working with MediaTek on the processor, which will use the Arm architecture rather than x86. Internal names mentioned include N1 and N1X. The report also references a separate project involving Intel. That design would combine an Intel x86 CPU with NVIDIA graphics and neural processing technology, targeting improved graphics in slimmer laptops without a discrete GPU.

NVIDIA has not formally announced either chip, meaning specifications, pricing, and final configurations remain undisclosed. However, we reported in January that NVIDIA\'s Arm-based N1 and N1X laptop chips were getting closer to launch, with Lenovo accidentally confirming several upcoming models, including Yoga and Legion designs, through a since-deleted support page listing. Dell was also spotted testing the N1X, with a November 2025 shipping manifest surfacing a "Dell 16 Premium" powered by an N1X engineering sample.

According to initial leaks, both chips are based on the same GB10 Superchip found in NVIDIA\'s DGX Spark AI mini PC, with the N1X reportedly packing 20 Arm CPU cores and a 48-unit iGPU. Despite expectations, NVIDIA skipped CES without any official announcement, and earlier rumors of delays pushing the launch to late 2026 hadn\'t been fully ruled out at the time. With NVIDIA GTC 2026 just a few weeks ahead (March 16-19), that\'s likely the event where those new mobile processors could be announced.
