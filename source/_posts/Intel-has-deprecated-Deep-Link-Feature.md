### Quick Report

Intel has deprecated the Deep Link feature, which was designed to enhance the performance of Intel's integrated graphics by allowing the CPU and GPU to work together more efficiently. This decision comes as Intel shifts its focus towards other technologies and features that align better with its current product roadmap.

The details were after several users complained that Deep Link was not working in OBS Studio, a popular streaming and recording software. Intel stated in their [GitHub Issue Tracker][def] that they are no longer supporting the Deep Link feature and that users should look for alternative solutions for their streaming and recording needs.

Current Intel Alchemist and Battlemage users were unhappy with this decision, as they had relied on the Deep Link feature for improved performance in gaming and content creation. However, Intel has assured users that they are committed to providing the best possible experience with their products and will continue to innovate in other areas.
