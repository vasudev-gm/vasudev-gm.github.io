### Quick Report

NVIDIA has reportedly evaluated Intel\'s 18A manufacturing process but decided not to proceed with mass production at Intel Foundry, according to Reuters.<!-- more -->

While this is not unusual—chip designers often test multiple foundries before committing—Intel\'s 18A node is still mainly used for internal products. Future nodes like 18A-P, 18A-PT, and 14A are being developed to attract more external customers, with early feedback on 14A described as competitive. The Intel-NVIDIA partnership is currently focused on integrating RTX GPUs into Intel x86 SoCs, with no foundry deal announced yet. The industry is watching closely as Intel prepares to launch its next-generation nodes in 2027.
