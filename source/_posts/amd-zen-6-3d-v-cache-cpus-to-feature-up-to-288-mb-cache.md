### Quick Report

AMD is preparing its next-generation Zen 6 client CPUs, which are expected to continue the 3D V-Cache trend with even larger cache sizes. According to recent leaks, single-CCD Zen 6 chips could feature 144 MB of 3D V-Cache, while dual-CCD models may reach a massive 288 MB.

This design keeps AMD\'s familiar approach of a client I/O die and two separate CCDs, each benefiting from increased cache. The move to TSMC\'s advanced N2P 2 nm node for the CCD and N3P 3 nm for the I/O die is expected to boost efficiency and performance. Zen 6 will also introduce new x86-64 instruction extensions, including AVX512_BMM, AVX512_FP16, AVX_NE_CONVERT, AVX_IFMA, and AVX_VNNI_INT8, bringing 16-bit AVX-512 calculations to mainstream desktops for the first time. These enhancements could provide a significant uplift in gaming and prosumer workloads, positioning Zen 6 as a strong competitor against Intel\'s upcoming Nova Lake CPUs, which are also rumored to feature large last-level caches.
