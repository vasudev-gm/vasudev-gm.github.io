### Quick Report

TCL CSOT has broken ground on the world\'s first 8.6-generation Inkjet Printing (IJP) OLED production line in Guangzhou, a project expected to boost high-end panel capacity for tablets, laptops and monitors.

The new production line, referred to as "t8", officially broke ground on October 21 and is designed for a monthly capacity of 22.5 thousand sheets based on a 2290 mm x 2620 mm substrate size. TCL says the project will focus on high-end AMOLED displays for IT applications, with a total investment estimated at roughly USD 4 billion.

Jun Zhao, Senior Vice President of TCL Technology and CEO of TCL CSOT, described the t8 line as a breakthrough for the global display industry that brings together the full value chain from materials to final assembly. The company highlighted its decade-plus investment in IJP OLED R&D and noted that its earlier G5.5 IJP OLED production line (t12) in Wuhan began mass shipments in 2024 and has been ramping up.

IJP OLED deposits organic light-emitting materials with precision using inkjet-style printing techniques. The approach delivers strong color performance, high resolution, improved energy efficiency, and better cost profiles that suit a wide range of devices â€” from small wearables to larger IT panels and automotive displays.

TCL CSOT also pointed to its intellectual property portfolio as a strategic advantage: the company claims roughly 9,700 OLED-related patents worldwide, including more than 1,200 specific to IJP OLED technologies. The move to build the world\'s first high-generation IJP OLED production line is framed as a step from follower to innovator in panel manufacturing.
