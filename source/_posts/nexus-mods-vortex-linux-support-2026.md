### Quick Report

Nexus Mods has announced that its Vortex mod manager will receive official Linux support in 2026, specifically targeting Valve\'s Steam Deck and Steam Machine. This move aims to modernize the Vortex experience and make modding more accessible for Linux gamers, especially those using SteamOS.

The development team clarified that support will focus on **vanilla Steam hardware** and not other Linux distributions, though Vortex\'s open-source nature allows community developers to extend compatibility. Currently, Linux users must manually install mods, but the upcoming update will streamline installation and maintenance. Other 2026 priorities include improved malware scanning, a revamped UI, and a new mod upload API.
