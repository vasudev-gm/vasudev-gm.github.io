### Quick Report

A creative add-on card featuring an AMD Promontory 21 FCH chipset has surfaced, allowing users to expand PCIe and SATA connectivity on single-chipset motherboards like B650, B850, or X870. The card provides four M.2 slots and four SATA 6 Gbps ports, with at least two Gen 4 x4 lanes, and can be used to add more storage options.

When installed on an Intel motherboard, system utilities such as AIDA64 are fooled into reporting an Intel CPU running on an AMD chipset. The card is niche and not widely available, but it demonstrates inventive ways to increase I/O flexibility for DIY PC builders.
