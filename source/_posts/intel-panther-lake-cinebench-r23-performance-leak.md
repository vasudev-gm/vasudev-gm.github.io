### Quick Report

Leaked Cinebench R23 scores for Intel\'s upcoming Panther Lake mobile CPUs—Core Ultra X7-358H and Ultra 5-338H—have surfaced, revealing performance that may disappoint enthusiasts. The single-core and multi-core results lag behind AMD\'s Ryzen 8000 series and Apple\'s M3 chips, raising questions about Panther Lake\'s competitiveness in the next generation of laptops.

Details from the leak:

- Core Ultra X7-358H: ~2,000 points single-core, ~15,000 points multi-core
- Core Ultra 5-338H: ~1,800 points single-core, ~13,000 points multi-core
- Both chips tested in pre-release laptops with 16GB LPDDR5X RAM
- Results are lower than AMD Ryzen 9 8945HS and Apple M3, which score higher in both categories

Why it matters:

- Panther Lake is Intel\'s first mobile CPU on the "Intel 18A" process, expected to launch in 2025
- Early scores suggest limited IPC and efficiency gains over Meteor Lake
- If these numbers hold, Intel may struggle to compete with AMD and Apple in premium thin-and-light laptops

Treat leaked benchmarks with caution—final retail performance may improve upon launch. However, these early results could signal challenges for Intel in regaining performance leadership.
