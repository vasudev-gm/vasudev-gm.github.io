### Quick Report

Hong Kong Tech Media HKEPC reports said Nvidia plans to announce RTX 5080 Blackwell after CES on Jan 21 2025. The announcement event will be done by Jensen Huang with RTX 5080 Blackwell utilizing 10752 CUDA cores with 16GB GDDR7 30 Gbps memory maunfactured by TSMC on 4nm node.

The said improvements are achieved through newer node as well as architectural improvements to focus on Content creation workloads, Media Encode/Decode, Ray tracing and AI. However users are frustrated with memory segmentation between 80 series and 90 series which is not a good sign for the future as performance parity is huge on 90 series due to double VRAM and core counts.

As part of CES 2025, Nvidia is hosting a LAN gaming party called Geforce LAN Event after 13 years to capture gamer\'s hearts, mind-share and wallet. Meanwhile, AMD has no competing products and Intel BattleMage is holding on due to more VRAM and conscious pricing.
