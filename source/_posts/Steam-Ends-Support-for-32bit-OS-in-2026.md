### Quick Report

Valve has confirmed that, effective January 1, 2026, Steam will stop supporting systems running 32-bit versions of Windows. Existing Steam Client installations on Windows 10 32-bit will continue to function in the near term but will no longer receive updates, including security fixes. Steam Support will not provide technical assistance for unsupported systems.

Steam noted that Windows 10 32-bit currently represents roughly 0.01% of systems in the Steam Hardware Survey. While 32-bit games will still run on supported 64-bit Windows versions, users on 32-bit Windows are encouraged to upgrade to a 64-bit OS to ensure continued updates, compatibility, and security.

The change is driven by dependencies on system drivers and libraries that are no longer maintained on 32-bit Windows. Valve emphasized that future Steam releases will be 64-bit only on Windows and urged affected users to migrate sooner rather than later.
