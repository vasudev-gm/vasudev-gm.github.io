### Quick Report

Microsoft Gaming head Phil Spencer has confirmed that the next-generation Xbox console will feature an in-house design, dispelling rumors that Microsoft might abandon first-party hardware development. The confirmation comes after ASUS launched the ROG Xbox Ally series, sparking speculation about Microsoft\'s hardware future.

In a recent interview with Famitsu, Spencer clarified Microsoft\'s hardware strategy, stating that while the ASUS ROG Ally represents the next Xbox hardware launch, Microsoft\'s own next-generation console will be their next first-party hardware release. This suggests no Microsoft-branded handheld gaming PCs will launch until at least 2027, when the next-gen Xbox is expected to arrive.

The confirmation follows earlier statements from Xbox president Sarah Bond, who mentioned Microsoft was "100% looking at making things in the future" but remained vague about specific plans. Spencer\'s comments provide clearer direction, confirming Microsoft\'s commitment to traditional console hardware while partnering with third parties for handheld solutions.

Previous rumors indicated Microsoft was developing an in-house gaming handheld before shifting that effort to ASUS. Meanwhile, Sony appears to be developing both handheld and home console systems, each with dedicated AMD-co-developed APUs, setting up an interesting competitive dynamic for the next console generation.
