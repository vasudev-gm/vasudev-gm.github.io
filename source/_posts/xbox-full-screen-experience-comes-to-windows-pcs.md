### Quick Report

Microsoft is rolling out the Xbox Full Screen Experience (FSE) to all Windows 11 PCs, not just handhelds. With Insider Preview Build 26220.7271, users can launch a console-like, controller-friendly interface that hides the desktop and minimizes background tasks for distraction-free gaming.

The new mode is activated via Game Bar settings or Win + F11, and is designed to fill the display with game tiles, mute notifications, and pause maintenance activities for consistent frame delivery. Navigation is handled by a game controller, and users can return to the desktop using Task View or Game Bar. The update is rolling out in phases to Insiders, with broader access coming soon. Early access is available by enrolling in the Xbox Insiders Program and enabling the PC Gaming preview.
