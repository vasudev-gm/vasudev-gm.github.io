### Quick Report

Microsoft has confirmed that it provided BitLocker recovery keys to the FBI, allowing authorities to unlock three laptops as part of a legal investigation. The request, made with a warrant, targeted devices from the Guam area protected by Microsoft’s BitLocker encryption.

A Microsoft spokesperson stated that BitLocker keys are stored online by default if users set up a Microsoft account, though customers can opt to store keys locally. While this offers convenience for key recovery, it introduces a significant privacy risk: government agencies can access encrypted data if they obtain a legal order. The incident has reignited debates about user privacy, the security of cloud-stored keys, and the responsibilities of tech companies when faced with government demands. Unlike Apple, which has previously refused to bypass device security for authorities, Microsoft and other tech giants have a history of compliance in such cases.
