It has quad channel memory controller with 64 bit bus width or even octa core memory controller with 32 bit bus width. It is also the first APU to support 128GB of RAM. The APU is also equipped with 16 cores and 32 threads. The APU is also equipped with 16MB of L3 cache. NPU performance tops out at 50 TOPS with 256bit memory controller, 40 Compute Units of RDNA3.5, 2x USB4, 2x USB3.2 Gen 2 and power consumption ranging from 45W to 150W.
