While HBM3E is critical for AI accelerators and high-performance computing, the broader DRAM market has seen explosive demand growth driven by data centers, AI infrastructure, and consumer devices. By reallocating some HBM3E capacity to standard DRAM, Samsung can address supply constraints and capture revenue opportunities in the mainstream memory segment. This flexibility demonstrates Samsung\'s ability to adapt its manufacturing strategy to market conditions.
