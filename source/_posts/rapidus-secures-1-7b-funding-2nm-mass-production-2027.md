The company has already taped out a 2 nm GAA test chip using ASML EUV tools and claims a competitive transistor density of 237 MTr/mm². Rapidus plans to continue raising funds as it moves from R&D to full-scale manufacturing, aiming to match TSMC\'s N2 node in logic density and global competitiveness.
