### Quick Report

Intel is working on set of patches to improve Arrow Lake gaming performance according to an exclusive HotHardware interview. Intel\'s Robert Hallock, GM & VP of Client and AI technical marketing addressed the huge performance regressing in gaming, content creation workloads, and other areas. He said the performance did not meet expectation of reviews and differed from their original claims and working to address by the end of the month via BIOS and OS updates.

Excerpt from Robert Hallock:
> I can\'t go into all the details yet, but we identified a series of multi-factor issues at the OS level, at the BIOS level, and I will say that the performance we saw in reviews is not what we expected and not what we intended. The launch just didn\'t go as planned. That has been a humbling lesson for all of us, inspiring a fairly large response internally to get to the bottom of what happened and to fix it.
