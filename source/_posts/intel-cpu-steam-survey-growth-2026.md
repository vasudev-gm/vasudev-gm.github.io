### Quick Report

For the first time in months, Intel\'s CPU share on the Steam Hardware Survey has increased, rising to 56.64% in January 2026. This 0.25% uptick ends a steady decline, while AMD\'s share dipped slightly to 43.34%.

AMD\'s Ryzen 9000X3D series remains popular among enthusiasts, but Intel\'s recent discounts and firmware updates may have helped stabilize its position. The upcoming Arrow Lake Refresh, expected in March or April, could further impact the market as both companies vie for PC gamers.
