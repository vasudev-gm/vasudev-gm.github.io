### Quick Report

PC prices are projected to rise by as much as 8% in 2026, according to analyst firm IDC. The main driver is a global shortage of DRAM and NAND, which is already forcing major vendors like Dell, Lenovo, HP, Acer, and ASUS to reset contracts and raise list prices for systems shipping in the second half of 2026.

IDC expects average selling prices to climb 4–6% in a moderate scenario, but warns that a severe shortage could push increases to 8%. The memory crunch is also slowing the rollout of AI PCs, as manufacturers reduce memory and storage in new models to protect margins. With consumer demand stagnant and enterprise refresh cycles limited by budgets, the industry faces a challenging year ahead. The transition to Windows 11 has also been slower than expected, further dampening PC sales momentum.
