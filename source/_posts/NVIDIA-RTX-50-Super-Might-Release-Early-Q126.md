### Quick Report

Reports from BenchLife.info and VideoCardz suggest NVIDIA could ship a mid-cycle **SUPER** refresh of the GeForce RTX 50-series in March–April 2026, possibly revealed at CES 2026. The rumored line-up includes RTX 5070 SUPER, RTX 5070 Ti SUPER, and RTX 5080 SUPER, focusing primarily on increased memory capacities (up to 24 GB on some SKUs) rather than major core-count changes.

According to leaks, the SUPER models will increase memory by about 50% over the SKUs they replace — examples: RTX 5070 SUPER (18 GB), RTX 5070 Ti SUPER and RTX 5080 SUPER (24 GB). NVIDIA is reportedly using newer 24 Gbit GDDR7 memory chips to reach these sizes. The report notes AIC partners haven\'t received product notifications yet, which aligns with an early-Q2 2026 shipping window.

Potential impact:

- Memory-focused refresh: Cards with larger VRAM help AI and content-creation workloads, and may extend the useful lifespan of mid-range parts.
- Timing and reveal: A CES announcement with shipping in March–April 2026 would give partners time to prepare boards and channels.
- Product strategy: SUPER refreshes historically aim to capture additional demand between major generations, rather than introduce sweeping architectural changes.
