### Quick Report

NVIDIA is set to introduce its first Arm-based Blackwell chip in Alienware gaming laptops, marking a significant shift in the gaming laptop market in early 2026. The ARM SoC is developed in collaboration with Mediatek utilizing Nvidia Blackwell architecture operating in 80-120W TDP range. This move is expected to enhance performance and efficiency in gaming laptops, with Alienware being the first to feature this technology. It will also include all latest AI features such as DLSS 4 MFG, Transformer model preset etc.

This comes as a surprise to many because Qualcomm Snapdragon ARM chips could not compete with Intel and AMD chips in the gaming laptop market due to compatibility and driver issues. NVIDIA's Blackwell chip is expected to change that narrative, offering a powerful alternative to traditional x86 processors.
