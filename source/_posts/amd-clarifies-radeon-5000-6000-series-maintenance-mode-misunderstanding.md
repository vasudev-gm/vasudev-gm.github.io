### Quick Report

AMD has clarified confusion around its "maintenance mode" for Radeon RX 5000 and RX 6000 series GPUs. While these products have transitioned out of active feature development, AMD says they will continue to receive first-day game support, critical bug fixes, and security updates via the Adrenalin driver channel. In short: reduced feature velocity does not mean abandonment.

<!-- more -->

What changed — and what didn\'t:

- Feature work targets newer architectures first (RDNA 3/4), but RDNA 1/2 remain supported.
- Day-0 game readiness is still planned for major releases that specify support for RX 5000/6000.
- Security patches and critical stability fixes continue.
- Optional feature backports may occur when technically feasible and beneficial.

Why it matters:

The term “maintenance mode” was interpreted by some as end-of-support. AMD\'s clarification indicates a support posture similar to long-term servicing: fewer new features, continued compatibility and security.

Guidance for users:

- Keep Adrenalin drivers up to date to receive day-0 profiles and fixes.
- Check per-release notes to confirm title-specific support for your GPU.
- For new features exclusive to newer GPUs, expect limited or no backports.
