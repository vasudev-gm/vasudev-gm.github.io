### Quick Report

Steam released a new stable update on 5 Nov 2024 that added Game Recording module which was in beta for a while. Similar to Nvidia App or GeForce Experience or AMD Adrenaline Record & Stream, Steam now allows you to record your gameplay and share it with your friends and social media showcasing game moments that works on Linux and Windows with steam deck and other devices.

What\'s more surprising is, it works with non-Steam games provided Steam overlay is running in background and works with Hardware Encoders used by Nvidia and AMD with CPU fallback. Intel GPU owners might be disappointed as it doesn\'t work with Arc GPU and has performance impacts with background recording which might be fixed in future updates. The settings page for Steam game recording also allows users to customize clip length, storage limit, and recording modes on a per-game basis as a free update.
