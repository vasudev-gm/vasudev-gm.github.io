### Quick Report

Microsoft is rolling out a new consent framework in Windows 11 that requires AI agents to request explicit user permission before accessing personal files. Six protected folders—Desktop, Documents, Downloads, Music, Pictures, and Videos—are off-limits by default, and each AI assistant must request access individually.

Users can grant permanent access, require reauthorization for each interaction, or deny requests entirely. The modular system allows granular control, letting users permit some actions (like system settings) while restricting file access. The move addresses growing privacy and security concerns as AI agents become more integrated into Windows.
