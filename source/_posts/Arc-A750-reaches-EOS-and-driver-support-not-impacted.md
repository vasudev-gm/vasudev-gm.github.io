### Quick Report

Intel has announced the end-of-life (EOL) status for several Arc Alchemist GPUs, including both desktop and mobile models. According to Product Change Notification (PCN) documents, the Arc A750 Limited Edition and several other Arc Alchemist products will be discontinued, with the last order date for the A750 set for June 27, 2025.

The EOL designations come shortly after Intel\'s leadership change, with Lip-Bu Tan taking over as CEO. Despite these product discontinuations, there\'s no indication that Intel plans to exit the discrete GPU market. The company\'s Arc Alchemist GPUs have made some impact in the mainstream and entry-level markets, even though they haven\'t achieved the market penetration of AMD and NVIDIA products.
