### Quick Report

Apple is rumored to launch its M5 Pro and M5 Max SoCs as early as March 2026, ahead of previous expectations for a first-half launch. The new chips will use TSMC\'s advanced SoIC (System on Integrated Chip) packaging, aiming to reduce production costs amid rising DRAM prices and Apple\'s reported slip from TSMC\'s priority customer list.

This move is seen as a response to increased manufacturing costs, partly driven by the AI boom and competition for foundry capacity. The M5 Pro and Max are expected to debut in new MacBook Pro models or possibly a Mac Studio refresh. The adoption of SoIC packaging could help Apple maintain competitive pricing or margins despite industry-wide cost pressures.
