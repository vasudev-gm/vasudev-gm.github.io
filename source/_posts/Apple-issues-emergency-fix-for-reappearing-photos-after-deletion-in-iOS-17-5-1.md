## Background

Apple released [iOS 17.5][def] which fixed a lot of vulnerabilities and bugs, but unfortunately it also introduced a new bug related to photos storage. Users reported that after deleting photos from their iPhone, the images would reappear in their camera roll after some time. <!-- more -->

After multiple reports from reddit users and news coverage about deleted photos reappearing on sold devices after applying iOS 17.5 caused people to be disappointed with Apple's privacy and testing methodology. This bug was also reported to be present in the latest iOS 17.5 update by the beta testers during the beta testing phase. Now, Apple has now released an emergency fix for this issue in [iOS 17.5.1][def4].

If you're wondering whether there is a sure-shot way to erase all photos database to start over you can read more about the article I wrote few years at [Notebook Talk Forum][def3]

Make sure you have backed up all the photos to iCloud or OneDrive or Google Photos before proceeding as it will permanently delete the photos or videos from your device.
