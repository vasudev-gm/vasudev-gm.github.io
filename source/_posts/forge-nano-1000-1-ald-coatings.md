### Quick Report

Forge Nano has announced a breakthrough in semiconductor manufacturing, demonstrating high-speed, defect-free atomic layer deposition (ALD) coatings at a 1000:1 aspect ratio. This innovation removes a key bottleneck in 3D chip scaling, enabling architectures previously considered uneconomic or impossible.

The company\'s patented turbulent flow ALD process, part of its Atomic Armor platform, achieves conformal coatings in extreme nanoscale features at 10x the speed of conventional methods. This technology is validated on production wafers and promises to improve yield, throughput, and cost for advanced memory like 3D NAND, DRAM, and HBM. The breakthrough could extend DRAM scaling, lower fab costs, and shift competitive dynamics in the chip industry.
