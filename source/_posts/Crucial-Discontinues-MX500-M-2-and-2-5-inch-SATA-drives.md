### Quick Report

Crucial has announced that it will be discontinuing the MX500 M.2 and 2.5 inch SATA drives after 7 years of market presence. It was the popular choice for users looking for well-rounded performance and value compared to Samsung EVO or PRO SATA SSDs.

Crucial recommends users to upgrade to QLC NVMe in M.2 format in terms of cost and storage capacity such as P3 Plus which comes in size of 4TB. Crucial MX500 is still available in select retailers until stocks run dry. Crucial still sells QLC SSD BX500 without DRAM that is a SATA III SSD using Micron 176 layer flash/NAND with SM2259XT v2 controller. Personally got a BX500 1TB version to replace my 8 year old Hitachi HDD 2.5" 1TB HDD and compared to old revision of BX500 with 64 layer NAND, the new version runs much cooler and much more performant for day-day usage.
