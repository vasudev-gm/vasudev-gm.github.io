### Quick Report

Intel has installed ASML\'s Twinscan EXE:5200B High-NA EUV scanner for its 14A node, becoming the first in the industry to transition from Low-NA to High-NA EUV lithography. This advanced machine enables higher wafer output, improved overlay precision, and faster cycle times for next-generation chips.
<!-- more -->

The EXE:5200B can process up to 175 wafers per hour, with Intel aiming for over 200. The 14A node is already showing better yield and performance than the previous 18A node, and volume production is planned for 2027. Intel\'s adoption of High-NA EUV is expected to enhance its foundry capabilities and attract new customers, though further expansion will require more advanced machines to meet demand.
