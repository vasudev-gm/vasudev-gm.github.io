### Quick Report

Microsoft has teamed up with ASUS and Dell to launch new Windows 365 cloud PC devices, echoing the classic **dumb terminal** concept. The ASUS NUC 16 and Dell Pro Desktop for Windows 365 feature modern hardware but run a stripped-down OS that launches directly into Office 365. These devices are expected in Q3 2026 and target corporate environments where only cloud-based productivity tools are needed.

While the hardware includes DDR5, Wi-Fi 6E, and USB-C, the focus is on cloud-only usage, signaling Microsoft\'s push to replace traditional PCs in some business settings. The move may suit organizations with simple needs but is unlikely to appeal to users requiring broader software access or local control.
