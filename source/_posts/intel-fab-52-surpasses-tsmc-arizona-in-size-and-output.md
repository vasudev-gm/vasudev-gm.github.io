### Quick Report

Intel\'s Fab 52 in Arizona has overtaken TSMC\'s local facility in both size and production, now outputting more than 40,000 wafers per month on the advanced 18A node.

While TSMC\'s Arizona Fab 21 currently produces about 20,000 wafers monthly on older 5 nm-class nodes, Intel\'s site boasts cutting-edge EUV tools and is ramping up yields for its Panther Lake CPUs and future products. Despite lower yields compared to TSMC, Intel\'s monthly output and investment in advanced manufacturing position it as a major U.S. foundry player. The facility is expected to house at least 15 EUV scanners, including the latest NXE:3800E and several NXE:3600D systems, supporting Intel\'s ambitions to catch up with and attract more external foundry clients.
