### Quick Report

Valve has announced that the Steam Machine and Steam Frame are affected by the ongoing memory and storage crisis, making it impossible to set final pricing or confirm launch dates. The company warns that prices may exceed the previously predicted $700-800 range.

The shortage, driven by AI demand, is impacting the entire hardware industry. Valve says the Steam Machine will still target 4K 60 FPS with FSR, and both RAM and SSDs will be user-upgradeable. The company will also release CAD files for custom faceplates. Launch dates remain unchanged for now, but pricing will depend on market conditions.
