### Quick Report

Apple announced the M5 SoC, which brings a next-generation 10-core GPU with a Neural Accelerator in every core, a faster 16-core Neural Engine, and 153 GB/s unified memory — delivering major on-device AI and graphics gains.

Apple says the M5 delivers over 4x peak GPU compute versus M4 and up to 6x AI compute compared to M1, with graphics improvements of up to 30% (and up to 45% in ray-traced workloads). The chip integrates dedicated Neural Accelerators in each GPU core and a faster 16-core Neural Engine, enabling larger models and faster inference on device.

The M5 also increases unified memory bandwidth to 153 GB/s and supports up to 32 GB of RAM, which Apple positions as key for running larger on-device models and demanding creative workflows. CPU performance improves modestly (around 10–15% multithreaded gains), while the GPU and AI subsystems see the largest jumps.

Apple is shipping M5 in the new 14-inch MacBook Pro, iPad Pro, and Apple Vision Pro, with pre-orders open today.
