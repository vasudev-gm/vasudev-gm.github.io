### Quick Report

A startup called Etched specializing in designing ASICs has decided to disrupt the gaming industry by creating games using AI model trained on their Transformer architecture dubbed the **Oasis**. Oasis is the first AI model that enables real time playable open world game that takes use's input and generate realtime gameplay content including physics, game rules and graphics.

Initially they used a NVIDIA H100 GPU Oasis is a model trained with 500 million parameters can run at 720p at 20 FPS. Due to GPU hardware limitations with H100/B200 4K is impossible at the moment. So to solve this, Etched created in-house accelerator called **Sohu** specialized for accelerating transformer architecture that can serve 65 Oasis run to 65 users and designed to run 100 Billion parameter gen AI video games which can output at 4K 30 FPS thanks to 144GB of HBM3E yielding 1,152 GB of VRAM in eight-way configuration.
