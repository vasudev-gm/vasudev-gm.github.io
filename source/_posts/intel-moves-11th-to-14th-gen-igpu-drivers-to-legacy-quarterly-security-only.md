### Quick Report

Intel has moved integrated graphics drivers for 11th through 14th Gen processors to **Legacy** status and stated the downloads will be maintained as quarterly security-only releases. That means these iGPU drivers will no longer receive regular feature, performance, or frequent quality updates; instead, Intel will publish security fixes on a quarterly cadence while recommending OEM and Windows Update drivers for routine compatibility and stability.

### What changed

According to Intel\'s driver download page for 11th–14th Gen processor graphics, the package is now listed as legacy and the release notes call out a security-only servicing model. In practice this changes Intel\'s support model for those integrated GPUs:

- No new feature additions or performance-tuning updates will be issued in monthly or ad-hoc driver releases.
- Drivers will continue to receive security fixes on a quarterly schedule.
- Users seeking the latest fixes or features should rely on OEM-supplied drivers or Windows Update, where Microsoft may provide DCH-certified variants.
- Laptop and desktop users relying on Intel integrated graphics on 11th–14th Gen processors for everyday tasks and light gaming. They may not see future feature or performance improvements from Intel\'s generic drivers.
- Creators and gamers who depend on the newest driver optimizations for games and media workloads; they should consider discrete GPUs or OEM driver channels for timely updates.
- IT administrators in enterprises who should audit driver baselines, test quarterly security updates, and update patching policies accordingly.

What users should do:

- Check your OEM\'s support site (Dell, HP, Lenovo, etc.) for vendor-specific driver packages; OEM drivers often include platform-specific fixes and validation.
- Use Windows Update as a first stop — Microsoft distributes DCH drivers and security fixes that may be suitable for most users.
- If you need the latest gaming or media optimizations, consider a discrete GPU or confirm whether the OEM provides a more frequently updated package.
- For enterprises, add the new quarterly security-only cadence to your driver management and testing plan so updates can be validated before deployment.

Moving older integrated GPU families to legacy, security-only servicing lets Intel focus engineering resources on current and future GPU architectures and products. It also aligns with common industry practice where older hardware receives reduced servicing once successor platforms are well established.
