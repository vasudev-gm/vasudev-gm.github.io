### Quick Report

With memory prices surging through late 2025 and early 2026, AMD is reportedly considering a revival of its AM4 Zen 3 CPUs. This move would help meet demand from gamers and upgraders seeking affordable options, as DDR4 and AM4 motherboards see renewed production from vendors like Gigabyte and ASUS.

AMD\'s VP David McAfee hinted at a possible reintroduction of Zen 3 products for the AM4 platform, aiming to provide significant upgrades without requiring a full system rebuild. Recent releases like the Ryzen 5 5600F and 5500X3D show AMD\'s ongoing support for the aging but popular socket, and a broader Zen 3 revival could further extend AM4\'s lifespan during the current supply crunch.
