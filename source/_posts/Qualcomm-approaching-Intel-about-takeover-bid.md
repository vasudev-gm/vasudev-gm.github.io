### Quick Report

After Intel\'s disappointing FY results for Q3, Qualcomm is reportedly approaching Intel about a takeover bid according to [WSJ rumours][def]. The rumour states, Qualcomm was eyeing some of the client divisions related chip design and foundry services. At the moment not much concrete information is available. Even if the rumours are true, it is unlikely that Intel will accept a takeover bid to risk x86 licensing and other IPs.

If the deals falls through, we might see the death of x86 or worse unless regulators step in to stop the monopoly.
