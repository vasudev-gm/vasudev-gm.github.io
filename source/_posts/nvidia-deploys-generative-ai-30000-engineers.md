### Quick Report

NVIDIA has rolled out generative AI tools to 30,000 engineers, partnering with Anysphere Inc. and using a customized Cursor IDE. This shift has reportedly tripled code output without increasing bug rates, impacting everything from GPU drivers to DLSS and chip design.

The company enforces strict testing for mission-critical code, ensuring reliability. AI-assisted workflows have already led to DLSS 4 and smaller, more efficient GPU dies. While some see this as PR, NVIDIA\'s approach could benefit both gamers and the industry, though the long-term effects remain to be seen.
