### Quick Report

Intel\'s flagship Bartlett Lake-S processor, the Core 9 273 PQE, has surfaced among enthusiasts but cannot boot on consumer motherboards like the ASUS ROG Maximus Z790 Apex. The chip features 12 P-Cores, 24 threads, a 125 W base TDP, and boosts up to 5.9 GHz single-core, with 36 MB L3 cache and Xe-LP graphics.

Despite its impressive specs, Intel has restricted Bartlett Lake-S to embedded and edge platforms, confirmed by ASRock and others. This means DIY users must source industrial motherboards to use the CPU, and gaming optimizations like APO/IPO are not supported. Compatibility and performance for gaming may be limited, as Intel targets this product for non-consumer applications.
