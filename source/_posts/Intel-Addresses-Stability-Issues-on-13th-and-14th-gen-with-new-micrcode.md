It is recommended to apply the BIOS firmware from vendors and test against all your workflows with intel baseline or performance profile to check if the apps are not crashing. If it is unstable users are requested to RMA at the earliest to avoid inventory delays. If it is stable, users can have peace of mind that Intel has already extended warranty by 2 years and few vendors such as MSI,Asus,HP have extended warranty by 2 years while Puget, Falcon System extended the warranty by 3 and 4 years respectively.

Intel is facing a lawsuit from shareholder after its financial turmoil and layoffs.
