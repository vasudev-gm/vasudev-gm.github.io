### Quick Report

Intel\'s next-generation Core Ultra 400 Nova Lake-S desktop processors are set to include NPUs capable of 74 TOPS throughput, far surpassing the 40 TOPS required for Microsoft Copilot+ native acceleration. This marks a major leap from previous Arrow Lake-S chips, which only offered 13 TOPS.

Not all Nova Lake-S models may reach 74 TOPS, but Intel is expected to ensure even entry-level SKUs meet Copilot+ requirements. AMD may still beat Intel to market with its Ryzen AI 400 **Gorgon Point** APUs. Nova Lake-S is rumored to launch in late 2026, targeting AI workloads and next-gen Windows features.
