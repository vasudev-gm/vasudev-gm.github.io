As a leader in innovative technology, ACEMAGIC today announced the upcoming launch of the ACEMAGIC Tank Centre series, introducing two new models, M1A PRO and M1A PRO+. Building on the success of the original TANK 03, the new lineup delivers significantly enhanced performance for gaming, AI workloads, and multi-display productivity, while retaining the series\' distinctive industrial design.

As PC hardware continues to evolve, high-performance computing is becoming increasingly compact, intelligent, and energy-efficient. ACEMAGIC has been at the forefront of this shift, demonstrating that mini PCs can deliver desktop-class performance without the size or complexity of traditional systems.

From TANK 03 to Tank Centre: A Proven Foundation

Launched in October 2023, the ACEMAGIC TANK 03 quickly gained recognition in the mini PC market for its bold design, powerful discrete-GPU configurations, and flexible performance control. Featuring options such as Intel Core i9-12900H paired with NVIDIA GeForce RTX graphics, the TANK 03 proved that compact systems could meet the demands of gaming, content creation, and professional workloads.

A defining feature of the TANK 03 was ACEMAGIC\'s three-mode performance dial, allowing users to instantly switch between Silent, Auto, and Performance modes, balancing acoustics and power based on real-time needs. Combined with a compact footprint and extensive I/O connectivity, the TANK 03 established itself as a benchmark for high-performance mini PCs.

Introducing the Tank Centre Series

The new Tank Centre series represents the next phase of this vision. While preserving the recognizable chassis and design language of the TANK 03, the M1A PRO and M1A PRO+ deliver substantial upgrades in computing capability and target distinct professional user groups.

- Tank Centre M1A PRO
  > Designed for gamers and developers, the M1A PRO is powered by the Intel Core i9-13900HK, offering strong single-core and multicore performance for demanding applications, modern games, and development environments.
- Tank Centre M1A PRO+
  > Aimed at AI engineers, researchers, and advanced computing professionals, the M1A PRO+ features the AMD Ryzen AI Max+ 395, enabling enhanced AI acceleration and computational efficiency for next-generation workloads.

While both models share the same core design philosophy, their rear I/O configurations differ, optimizing connectivity for their respective use cases.

Consistent Design, Enhanced Thermal Performance

Both Tank Centre models retain the signature elements that define the TANK lineup, including the distinctive industrial aesthetic, customizable RGB lighting, and the three-mode performance dial. Internally, the systems employ an upgraded cooling solution with large-diameter fans and multiple heat pipes, ensuring stable performance under sustained high loads.

Users can easily adjust system behavior via the performance dial, selecting Silent, Auto, or Performance modes to suit different environments and workloads.

A Step Toward Future-Ready Computing

With the launch of the Tank Centre series, ACEMAGIC continues to push the boundaries of what compact PCs can achieve. By combining high-end processors, advanced thermal design, and a recognizable product identity, the company aims to deliver future-ready computing solutions in an increasingly space-conscious world.

Availability and regional rollout details will be announced in due course.

The product has officially launched today with early-bird pricing set at $2,499 for the US market and €2,299 for the EU market. ACEMAGIC will share further launch updates in the coming weeks.
