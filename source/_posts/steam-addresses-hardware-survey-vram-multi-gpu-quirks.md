### Quick Report

Valve has released a Steam Deck Beta client update that addresses two longstanding issues in the Steam Hardware Survey: incorrect VRAM reporting for some GPUs and quirks with multi-GPU setups. The client now automatically detects the display adapter with the most VRAM, likely improving survey accuracy for users with both gaming and workstation GPUs.

These changes should result in more reliable hardware data, though Valve has not specified which GPUs were affected or how widespread the issues were. The update also includes minor improvements to Steam Input, such as a multi-button selector for grip buttons and tweaks to Gyro-to-Joystick behavior. These refinements may be in preparation for upcoming Steam hardware launches.
