### Quick Report

AMD has unveiled its **1000 FPS Club**, claiming that three of its high-end processors with 3D V-Cache technology can achieve frame rates exceeding 1,000 frames per second in popular eSports titles. According to promotional materials recently shared at a presentation in China, the Ryzen 7 9800X3D, Ryzen 9 9950X3D, and mobile Ryzen 9 9955HX3D processors can break the four-digit FPS barrier in select competitive games when paired with premium graphics cards.

The marketing presentation, which was spotted by X user @realVictor_M and translated from Chinese, highlights AMD\'s continued dominance in gaming performance. These remarkable frame rates were achieved in six specific eSports titles at 1080p resolution: Counter Strike 2, League of Legends, Valorant, PUBG, Naraka: Bladepoint, and Marvel Rivals.

Interestingly, not all hardware configurations could hit the 1000 FPS mark across all games. AMD\'s testing revealed that only systems equipped with NVIDIA\'s RTX 5080 or 5090D (a China-exclusive cutdown version of the RTX 5090) could reach this performance level in all six titles when paired with a Ryzen 7 9800X3D or Ryzen 9 9950X3D, respectively. AMD\'s own Radeon RX 9070 XT GPU only managed to break the 1000 FPS threshold in two games: Valorant and League of Legends.

The test systems utilized 6000 MT/s CL30 RAM and ran on Windows 11 with Smart Access Memory (AMD\'s implementation of Resizable BAR) enabled and virtualization disabled. While AMD included the mobile Ryzen 9 9955HX3D in its "1000 FPS Club," the company did not provide specific benchmark data for this processor, leaving its performance claims unverified.

This achievement, while impressive, has limited practical application in current gaming environments. Even the fastest modern gaming monitors top out at 720Hz refresh rates, and those only achieve such speeds at reduced 720p resolution. There are reports of 1000Hz monitors in development through a collaboration between AMD and a Chinese eSports firm, but these aren\'t expected until 2026.

The demonstration comes amid growing recognition of AMD\'s gaming performance advantage. According to the latest Steam hardware survey, AMD processors have surpassed the 40% market share threshold, reflecting the increasing popularity of their gaming-focused chips. This growing market presence has been further bolstered by professional eSports players publicly praising AMD\'s X3D processors, with one Counter-Strike 2 pro recently claiming the game runs poorly on anything other than AMD\'s Ryzen 9800X3D.
