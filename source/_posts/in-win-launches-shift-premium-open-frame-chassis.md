### Quick Report

In Win has launched SHIFT, a premium open-frame PC chassis that combines testbench flexibility with refined aesthetics and integrated cable management. Crafted from CNC-machined and extruded aluminum with a sandblasted finish, SHIFT supports up to E-ATX motherboards and 350 mm graphics cards while incorporating tool-less GPU mounting, adjustable extension wings for radiators or PSUs, and hidden cable routing. The chassis targets enthusiasts who want a showcase build without the visual clutter of exposed wiring, backed by In Win\'s free mobile app with 3D assembly guides for iOS and Android.

SHIFT represents In Win\'s commitment to premium materials and precision engineering. Every component uses aerospace-grade aluminum with CNC machining for complex geometries and extrusion for structural elements. The sandblasted finish provides a uniform texture that resists fingerprints while complementing modern PC hardware aesthetics. Laser engravings add detail without compromising the minimalist design language.

Attention to detail extends to functional elements that endure repeated use. Screw holes feature reinforced threading to prevent wear during multiple assembly cycles—a critical consideration for testbenches and showcases that see frequent hardware changes. This durability focus aligns with In Win\'s target audience of professionals, engineers, and enthusiasts who demand longevity alongside aesthetics.

SHIFT accommodates a wide range of components:

- **Motherboards**: ATX, Micro-ATX, and E-ATX form factors
- **Graphics cards**: Up to 350 mm in length
- **GPU mounting**: Tool-less holders support vertical, horizontal, or multi-GPU configurations
- **Cooling**: Quick-release clamps allow extension wings to angle from 0° to 90° for radiator placement
- **Power supplies**: Adjustable positioning with dedicated mounting points
- **Storage**: Multiple 2.5" SSD mounting locations

The tool-less GPU mounting system uses spring-loaded clamps rather than traditional screws, enabling rapid card swapping for benchmarking or testing. Extension wings attach via quick-release mechanisms that lock at any angle, providing flexibility for custom loop radiators, reservoir placement, or oversized power supplies.

Unlike most open-frame designs, SHIFT incorporates hidden cable routing channels. Traditionally, open chassis sacrifice cable management for hardware accessibility, resulting in visible wire bundles that detract from component visibility. In Win addresses this by routing cables through the aluminum frame structure itself, with strategic cutouts for power, data, and cooling connections.

This approach keeps the focus on hardware rather than wiring, making SHIFT suitable for photography, streaming setups, or showroom displays where aesthetics matter. The integrated channels accommodate standard ATX power cables, RGB headers, fan connectors, and front-panel wiring without requiring aftermarket cable combs or extensions.

SHIFT embodies In Win\'s iBuildiShare philosophy, which encourages the DIY community to embrace building as a creative and social activity. The chassis serves as a platform for experimentation, allowing builders to reconfigure layouts, test different cooling approaches, and showcase hardware without traditional case constraints.

To simplify the building process, In Win provides a free mobile application (available for iOS and Android) featuring interactive 3D assembly instructions. The app guides users through each step with rotatable models, highlighting screw positions, cable paths, and component placement. This accessibility lowers the barrier for first-time open-frame builds while providing a reference for experienced builders tackling complex configurations.

SHIFT competes in the premium open-frame segment against products like the AZZA Pyramid 804, Cooler Master MasterFrame 700, and custom testbenches. Pricing information was not disclosed in the press release, but In Win\'s use of CNC-machined aluminum and precision engineering typically positions their products at the higher end of the market.

The chassis targets several use cases:

- **Benchmark testing**: Quick hardware swaps for review sites and overclockers
- **Showcase builds**: LAN parties, trade shows, and content creation where visibility matters
- **Development platforms**: System integrators and hardware engineers testing component compatibility
- **Artistic builds**: Custom loop enthusiasts who treat PC building as a form of expression
