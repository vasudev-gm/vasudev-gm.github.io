Key Highlights Include:

- **Advanced Architecture**: 10-core CPU in a 1+7+2 configuration featuring the latest Arm cores:
  - 1x Cortex-X5 at 3.3 GHz
  - 2x Cortex-A725 at 2.74 GHz
  - 5x Cortex-A725 at 2.36 GHz
  - 2x Cortex-A520 at 1.8 GHz

- **Powerful AI**: NPU capable of up to 59 trillion operations per second (TOPS), representing a 39% improvement over the previous Exynos 2400

- **Graphics Capability**: Custom 4th generation Xclipse 950 GPU based on AMD\'s RDNA 3 architecture with enhanced ray tracing capabilities for console-level graphics

- **Manufacturing Process**: Built on Samsung\'s advanced 3nm Gate All Around (GAA) technology with fan-out wafer-level packaging (FOWLP) for improved power efficiency and thermal management

- **Memory Support**: LPDDR5X RAM compatibility for faster data access and processing

- **Enhanced Camera Support**: Compatible with ultra-high-resolution sensors up to 320MP, 8K video recording at 60fps, and 8K playback at 30fps

- **Connectivity**: Integrated 5G modem supporting 3GPP Rel. 17 standards with maximum downlink speeds of 9.6 Gbps (FR1) and 12.1 Gbps (FR2), plus support for non-terrestrial networks (NTN) for satellite connectivity

- **Additional Features**: Wi-Fi 7 and Bluetooth 5.4 support, plus built-in GNSS for improved location services

Samsung claims a 15% improvement in big-core performance compared to the Exynos 2400. The new chip also offers better power efficiency through architectural improvements across various blocks, including CPU core structure optimization and implementation of an analog GNSS interface.

The Exynos 2500\'s on-device generative AI capabilities allow for advanced image editing features, including removing unwanted subjects from photos or expanding backgrounds, all processed securely on the device rather than in the cloud.

The Exynos 2500 is positioned to compete with other flagship mobile processors and is expected to power Samsung\'s upcoming Galaxy S26 series in certain markets. With its significant improvements in AI processing, graphics capabilities, and overall performance, Samsung is clearly focusing on enabling advanced on-device AI experiences while maintaining competitive gaming and multimedia performance.
