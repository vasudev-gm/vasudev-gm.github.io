### Quick Report

Intel has confirmed that any expansion of its upcoming 14A wafer manufacturing capacity will be contingent on securing customer commitments. The company will not invest in additional 14A foundry capacity for external clients until firm manufacturing contracts are signed, aiming to avoid speculative spending and align investments with real demand.

During its Q4 2025 earnings call, Intel stated that the 14A node is on track for 2027, with yields improving steadily. CEO Lip-Bu Tan and CFO David Zinsner emphasized that only R&D and technology development spending will proceed before customer orders are secured. This approach mirrors industry practices, where major customers often co-invest in capacity expansion. Intel also highlighted its advanced packaging capabilities, such as EMIB, as a differentiator for future foundry clients.
