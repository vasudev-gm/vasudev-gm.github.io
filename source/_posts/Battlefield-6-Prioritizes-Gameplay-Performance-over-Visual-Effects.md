### Quick Report

Ripple Effect Studios has confirmed that Battlefield 6 will not include ray tracing at launch or in near-future updates, prioritizing gameplay performance and accessibility over advanced visual effects. This decision stems from lessons learned from Battlefield 2042\'s optimization issues and the need for smooth frame rates in fast-paced multiplayer shooters.

Key highlights:

- **No Ray Tracing:** The game skips ray tracing to ensure broad compatibility and high performance across various hardware configurations.
- **Focus on Performance:** Emphasis on delivering massive battles, destruction, and customization without sacrificing frame rates or accessibility.
- **Upscaling Technologies:** Relies on DLSS 4, FSR 4, and XeSS 2 for performance boosts, though the engine runs efficiently without them.
- **Player Feedback:** Open beta tests showed smooth performance on diverse systems, with over 600 PC settings for customization.
- **Developer Quote:** Technical Director Christian Buhl stated, "No, we are not going to have ray tracing when the game launches and we don't have any plans in the near future for it either."

This approach aims to make Battlefield 6 accessible to a wider audiences, avoiding the performance penalties associated with ray tracing in competitive multiplayer games.
