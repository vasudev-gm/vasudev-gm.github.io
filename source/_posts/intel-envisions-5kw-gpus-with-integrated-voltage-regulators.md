The company presented its findings at a recent industry event, noting that integrating voltage regulation directly onto the GPU package could enable more efficient power delivery and thermal management. As AI models and HPC tasks become more demanding, the ability to support higher power densities will be critical for performance scaling. Intel\'s research suggests that such innovations could pave the way for GPUs far more powerful than those available today.
