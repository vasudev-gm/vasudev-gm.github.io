## Quick Report

The European Union has once again slapped Microsoft with an anti-trust rule, this time for bundling its Teams application with its popular Office suite. The ruling comes after complaints from rival company Slack, who argued that Microsoft was using its dominant position in the market to unfairly promote its own product. The EU has ordered Microsoft to offer a separate download for Teams and to stop forcing users to install it as part of the Office suite.

If EU finds Microsoft guilty it could face upto 10% of worldwide turnover and implement remedies to ensure fair competition.
