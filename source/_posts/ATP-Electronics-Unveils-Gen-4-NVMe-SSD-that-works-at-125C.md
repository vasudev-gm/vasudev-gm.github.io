### Quick Report

ATP Electronics announced their high endurance NVMe Gen 4 M.2 2280 called **N751Pi** configured with pseudo-Single Level Cache (pSLC).

Thanks to stringent vertical integration of prime NAND package Integrated Circuits (IC) and validation creating a 150K P/E(Program Erase) cycling configuration was achieved.

The drive is rated for 75 DWPD (Drive Writes Per Day). Thanks to higher PE cycles the data retention capability is superior which can store data up to a year even at harsh operating temperature of 55C thereby outperforming competitors.

With clever firmware optimization and tight screening of ICs the SSD can operate without any issues even at 125C drive temperature. The drive can work even below freezing up to -40C without compromising data integrity.

There are customizable heatsinks available in sizes of 4mm, 8mm and copper foil heatsink based on customer requirements. The drive supports hardware based Power Loss Protection (PLP) and available in size ranging from 240GB to 3.84TB.
