### Quick Report

NVIDIA has received approval from Taiwan\'s Ministry of Economic Affairs to establish its new regional headquarters in the Beitou-Shilin Technology Park, Taipei. The investment, now set at NT$3.3 billion (over US$105 million), is a significant increase from earlier reports and highlights NVIDIA\'s commitment to the region. The site was previously allocated to an insurance company but has remained vacant since 2021; NVIDIA will take over the plot following contract finalization before Lunar New Year. The new subsidiary will be named NVIDIA Iconic Taiwan Co.

The move is timed with CEO Jensen Huang\'s visit to Taiwan for the Lunar New Year, and is expected to strengthen NVIDIA\'s ties with local partners and the broader Asian tech ecosystem. The reason for the increased investment was not disclosed.
