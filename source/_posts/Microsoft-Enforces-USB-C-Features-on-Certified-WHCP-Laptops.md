### Quick Report

Microsoft has announced that all Windows Hardware Certification Program (WHCP) laptops must support USB-C features such as DisplayPort, Power Delivery, and Alternate Mode. This ensures that certified devices will be compatible with a wide range of USB-C peripherals and accessories. The move aims to standardize connectivity options across devices and enhance user experience by promoting the use of universal ports.
