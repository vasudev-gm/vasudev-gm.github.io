## About Me

Welcome! I\'m Vasudev Menon, a passionate Python developer and tech enthusiast. After exploring various blogging platforms, I discovered Hexo, which has enabled me to create this space where I can share my knowledge and insights with you.

My goal is to break down complex technical concepts into clear, actionable insights. Here, you'll find in-depth coverage of cutting-edge AI developments, emerging technologies, practical development tools, and comprehensive guides across Android, iOS, Windows, and Linux platforms. Whether you're a fellow developer, tech enthusiast, or just curious about the latest in technology, there's something here for you.

## What I do?

I\'m a Python Backend Developer and have worked on Django, Flask, FastAPI, Web Scraping, App Containerization, file based DB (SQLite), RDBMS (MySQL,Postgres), and Document Based (MongoDB)
