### Quick Report

Intel has secured a significant win by landing Tesla\'s Dojo 3 packaging contract, signaling a new dual-supplier approach where Samsung Electronics Foundry will manufacture the custom D3 AI-training chips while Intel handles the packaging and testing. This partnership leverages Intel\'s Embedded Multi-Die Interconnect Bridge (EMIB) technology to connect multiple dies through silicon bridges rather than a full-wafer interposer.

- Tesla has chosen a dual-vendor approach for its Dojo 3 AI supercomputer, splitting responsibilities between Samsung and Intel
- Samsung will manufacture the next-generation AI6 chips on a 2nm process
- Intel will handle packaging using its EMIB technology
- This marks a departure from Tesla\'s previous reliance on TSMC for both fabrication and System-on-Chip packaging
- The partnership addresses capacity constraints at TSMC for its Chip-on-Wafer-on-Substrate (CoWoS) services
