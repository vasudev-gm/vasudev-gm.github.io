### Quick Report

Denuvo decides to let go of bygones and focus on the future by creating a discord server to have better engagement with the community. After two days the server was shut down due to gamers being fed up with performance issues and massive game data size over the years.

Rock Paper Shotgun recently published an interview article with Denuvo\'s Product Manager Andreas Ullmann where he defended the company\'s DRM and performance issues instead blaming on gamers and their toxic nature. He deflected lot of repeated questions with community\'s claim of causing games to run slower and said gamers wants to play games for free instead of paying for them.

Ullmann seems to forget there are companies such as GOG (Good Old Games) that publish and sell DRM-free games without any performance (related game loading and data sizes) and piracy issues. If games rolled out with Denuvo or any other DRMs require constant internet connection to play, then it effectively becomes unplayable once developers pull the plug and remove the servers.
