### Quick Report

AMD has notified its supply chain and AIB partners of an upcoming 10% price hike across its entire GPU lineup, citing a severe global memory shortage as the main driver.

The shortage has caused DRAM prices to surge, with major suppliers like Samsung and SK Hynix only able to fulfill about 70% of orders. Smaller OEMs may see even lower fulfillment rates into early 2026. The price increase is expected to take effect after the holiday season, with AIBs likely to match AMD\'s move to protect their margins. This comes just as Radeon RX 9070 and 9070 XT cards finally reached MSRP, and follows a previous price restructuring in October. PowerColor has urged gamers to buy now before the hike hits. The memory crunch is expected to impact the entire PC and gaming hardware market.
