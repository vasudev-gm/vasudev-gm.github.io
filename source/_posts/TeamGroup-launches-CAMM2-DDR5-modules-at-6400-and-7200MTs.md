Excerpt from Teamgroup\'s [press release][def]:
> The consumer-grade CAMM2 memory from TEAMGROUP operates at DDR5 7200 MHz CL34-42-42-84 【1】 under manual overclocking, delivering exceptional performance. Compared to the default JEDEC specification, the module offers write, copy, and read speeds of up to 108,000MB/s, 106,000MB/s, and 117,000MB/s, respectively, while reducing overall latency to 55ns. The module delivers smoother performance when running large applications, gaming, or multitasking. The potential to achieve ultra-high frequencies of 8000-9000 MHz in the future further underscores its superior capabilities. CAMM2 is designed for industrial control, edge computing, and AI applications, providing robust support for high-performance computing and real-time data processing. It supports dual-channel mode with a single memory module, simplifying system architecture and significantly reducing power consumption. With an integrated CKD (Client Clock Driver) for improved signal integrity, CAMM2 memory is smaller and ideal for thin and light notebooks. Its improved thermal design allows for greater heat dissipation efficiency, unlocking more potential in a compact space.
