### Quick Report

Intel\'s next-generation Nova Lake CPUs may not include support for AVX10, APX, and AMX instructions, according to the latest GCC compiler patch. These advanced instruction sets, which enable 512-bit acceleration and fast vector/matrix operations, could remain exclusive to Xeon processors.

The patch contradicts earlier indications that AVX10.2 would be supported on future Core processors. For now, Nova Lake is expected to support AVX, AVX2, and a range of other instructions, but not the newest vector and matrix extensions. AMD, meanwhile, has introduced full AVX-512 support across its Zen 5 lineup, providing a performance boost in optimized applications. More details from Intel are awaited to confirm the final instruction set for Nova Lake consumer CPUs.
