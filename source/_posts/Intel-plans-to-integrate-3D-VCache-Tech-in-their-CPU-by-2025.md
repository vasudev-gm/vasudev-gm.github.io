### Quick Report

In a recent interview with Der8auer and Bens Hardware, Florian Maislinger, a tech communications manager for Intel, revealed that Intel plans to integrate 3D-VCache technology into their CPUs by 2025. This technology is expected to provide a significant performance boost for Intel's CPUs.

Florian said Intel is planning to add large shared L3 cache approach in a phased approach starting with server process that will compete with AMD EPYC Genoa-X and Turin-X CPUs. Intel believes that this approach will provide a significant performance boost for their CPUs especially with cache intensive software suites such as Ansys.

At the moment Intel is busy with providing microcode fixes for Arrow Lake CPUs that began shipping in November 2024 to compete against AMD Zen 5 X3D variants and non-X3D variants.
