### Quick Report

Novachips introduced its P2-series self-encrypting SSDs, designed to meet CNSA 2.0 post-quantum security recommendations. Built on the in-house NV7X processor, P2 adds QR algorithms such as ML-KEM-1024 (FIPS 203) and ML-DSA-87 (FIPS 204), plus a physical entropy source exposed via Crypto API to offload PQ operations from host CPUs.

The P2-series targets embedded and edge systems with improved read/write bandwidth and better power efficiency than the prior P-series. Form factors include 2.5-inch SATA, U.2 and M.2 for PCIe, and USB flash drive, with user capacities from 500 GB to 16 TB. Environmental durability aligns with MIL-STD-810G; security validations for FIPS-140-3 and Common Criteria are planned, and the predecessor\'s certifications are already completed.
