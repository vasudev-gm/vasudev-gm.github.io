DHRUV64 is designed for strategic and commercial applications, supporting sectors like 5G, automotive, industrial automation, IoT, and consumer electronics. The chip leverages modern fabrication techniques and offers high efficiency, multitasking, and reliability. It is part of the Digital India RISC-V (DIR-V) initiative, which aims to build a robust indigenous semiconductor ecosystem.

The launch of DHRUV64 follows earlier efforts such as SHAKTI, AJIT, VIKRAM, and THEJAS processors, and accelerates India\'s roadmap for future chips like Dhanush and Dhanush+. National programs like ISM, C2S, DLI, and INUP-i2i are supporting this ecosystem, training talent and fostering innovation. DHRUV64\'s open RISC-V architecture eliminates license costs and encourages collaboration across startups, academia, and industry.
