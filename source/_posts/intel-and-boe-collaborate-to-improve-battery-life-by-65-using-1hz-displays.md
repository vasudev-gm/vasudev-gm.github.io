### Quick Report

Intel has partnered with Chinese display manufacturer BOE to introduce laptop displays capable of operating at a 1 Hz refresh rate. This means static content, such as images, can be shown with minimal power usage, resulting in up to 65% longer battery life for future laptops.

The new Multi-Frequency Display (MFD) technology, managed by Intel graphics drivers and the operating system, automatically adjusts the panel\'s refresh rate based on the contentâ€”boosting it for dynamic actions like scrolling, and dropping to 1 Hz for static screens. SmartPower HDR further optimizes energy use by dynamically adjusting display voltage and brightness during HDR playback, reducing power draw in darker scenes while maintaining visual quality.

These innovations are expected to debut in Intel\'s 2026 laptop lineup, likely paired with Panther Lake CPUs. BOE will supply the panels, and Intel will coordinate the launch with its next major CPU release.
