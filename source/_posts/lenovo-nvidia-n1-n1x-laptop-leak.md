### Quick Report

Lenovo has inadvertently confirmed several upcoming laptops featuring NVIDIA\'s N1 and N1X APUs, including new IdeaPad Slim, Yoga Pro, Yoga 9, and Legion 7 models. The leak, found on Lenovo\'s support pages, highlights NVIDIA\'s growing ambitions in ARM-based Windows notebooks.

The N1X is linked to NVIDIA\'s powerful GB10 Superchip, previously seen in AI mini desktops, while the N1 may be a cut-down variant. This move could make Lenovo among the first to launch true Windows 11 on Arm gaming laptops, with models like the Yoga 9 2-in-1 16N1X11 and Legion 7 15N1X11. The leak suggests a near-term launch, despite earlier rumors of delays.
