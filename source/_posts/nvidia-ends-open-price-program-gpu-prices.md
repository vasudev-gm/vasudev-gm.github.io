### Quick Report

NVIDIA has ended its Open Price Program (OPP), which previously helped keep GPU prices at or near MSRP for add-in card (AIC) partners. With OPP gone, AICs can now set prices well above MSRP, especially as GDDR7 memory costs rise and supply tightens.

The change is expected to drive up prices for current and future RTX models, with NVIDIA prioritizing higher-margin SKUs like the RTX 5080. The OPP\'s end means less price stability for consumers and more volatility in the GPU market, as partners pass on increased costs.
