### Quick Report

AMD has announced Project GAIA (Generative AI Is Awesome), an open-source LLM that runs on CPUs and Ryzen AI NPUs locally.
<!-- more -->

Currently it works on Windows with Zen 5 SoC with Ryzen AI NPUs. It comes in two flavours standard CPU based and Ryzen AI NPU/GPU based called Hybrid Installer. It supports latest AI models from Deepseek, OpenAI, Gemma etc for text, image, code and reasoning to run LLMs locally with better privacy.

Support on older Ryzen AI NPU is unknown since initial version only works in handful of latest Zen 5 with Ryzen AI NPUs and AI Max SoCs. You can find github source [here][def]
