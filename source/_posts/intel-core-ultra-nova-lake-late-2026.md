### Quick Report

Intel has confirmed that its Core Ultra Series 4 "Nova Lake" processors will launch in late 2026, targeting both desktop and mobile platforms. Nova Lake-S will use the new LGA1954 socket and bring major architectural changes, including up to 16 performance and 32 efficiency cores, a Xe3 "Celestial" iGPU, and a new NPU for Copilot+ features.

The platform will also introduce BLLC (big last-level cache) SKUs to compete with AMD\'s 3D V-Cache, and debut new "Coyote Cove" P-cores and "Arctic Wolf" E-cores with improved IPC. HyperThreading will not be present on P-cores, but higher core counts aim to offset this. Arrow Lake Refresh will precede Nova Lake by year-end.
