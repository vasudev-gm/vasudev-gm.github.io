### Quick Report

Kingston has warned that SSD shortages will worsen over the next 30 days, with NAND flash prices already up 246% in 2025. The company expects further price hikes as demand outpaces supply, affecting both SSDs and HDDs.

Kingston\'s datacenter SSD manager highlighted that 70% of the price increase occurred in just the last 60 days, and uncertainty in the supply chain is driving OEMs to secure more NAND contracts. The ongoing AI boom is fueling demand for all types of storage, and even traditional HDD prices are rising. Industry experts advise against panic buying but acknowledge that the shortage could persist for several more months.
