### Quick Report

ChangXin Memory Technologies (CXMT) is set to dedicate 20% of its total mass production capacity—about 60,000 wafers per month—to HBM3 memory lines in 2026. This move marks a significant step for China\'s domestic memory industry, as CXMT aims to catch up with global leaders like SK hynix and Samsung in the high-bandwidth memory (HBM) market.

The shift is driven by surging demand for HBM in AI accelerators and data center hardware, especially as Chinese firms like Huawei seek homegrown solutions amid ongoing sanctions. While this may limit the supply of cheaper DRAM for consumers, it positions CXMT as a key player in the AI and HPC memory race.
