### Quick Report

Alphacool has announced its new Core 70 Tube Reservoir paired with an Apex pump, targeting modern custom water-cooling loops that need both cleaner aesthetics and easier service access. The unit combines a real glass tube, integrated lighting, and chrome-plated brass threads in the company\'s Core design language.

The company says the rotatable mounting brackets should make placement easier across different chassis layouts, while an interchangeable tube top is intended to simplify filling and bleeding. Alphacool also positions the included Apex pump as a quiet, long-life, high-performance unit for sustained loop operation.

At launch, Alphacool lists the Core 70 Tube Reservoir with Apex pump at an MSRP of €199.98 through its own store channel.
