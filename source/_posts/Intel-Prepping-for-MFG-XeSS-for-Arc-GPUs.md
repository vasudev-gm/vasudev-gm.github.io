### Quick Report

Intel is preparing to introduce **Multi-Frame Generation (MFG)** technology to its XeSS upscaling software for Arc GPUs, according to recent code leaks. This move could significantly enhance frame generation efficiency, potentially matching or rivaling NVIDIA\'s latest advancements in the field.

Currently, Intel\'s XeSS boosts performance by reconstructing subpixel details from a single frame. The new MFG approach, inspired by NVIDIA\'s multi-frame generation for RTX 50 series, would analyze two rendered frames to generate three additional frames, resulting in up to an 8x increase in rendering efficiency. This could allow Arc GPUs, especially the upcoming B770 **Battlemage**, to achieve much higher frame rates with minimal loss in visual fidelity.

While NVIDIA\'s solution leverages years of supercomputer-driven DLSS training, Intel aims to deliver similar results through its engineering efforts. There is no official launch date, but MFG-enhanced XeSS may debut with high-end Arc GPUs during the holiday season.
