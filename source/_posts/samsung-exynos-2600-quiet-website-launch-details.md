### Quick Report

Samsung has published the Exynos 2600 on its semiconductor site without the typical marketing push, but the listed specifications are substantial: a 2
nm GAA process, a CPU cluster topped by a 3.8
GHz prime core, an Xclipse 960 GPU with ray tracing support, and a dedicated AI engine built around a 32K-MAC NPU. More details are expected closer to CES.<!-- more -->

Based on the published information cited by TechPowerUp, the CPU configuration is described as one C1-Ultra prime core at 3.8
GHz, three C1-Prox3 performance cores at 3.25
GHz, and six efficiency cores at 2.75
GHz, with Arm v9.3-era architecture.

Samsung also lists display and media capabilities such as up to 120
Hz refresh at 4K/WQUXGA-class resolutions, plus 8K encode/decode support (with specific limits depending on encode vs decode). On imaging, the published specs mention support for very high-resolution single-camera configurations and high-frame-rate capture at 108
MP.

The GPU is positioned around Exynos Neural Super Sampling (ENSS), described as AI-powered upscaling and frame generation, and the platform also mentions Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) support.
