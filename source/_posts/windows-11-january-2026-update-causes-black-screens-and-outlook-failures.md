### Quick Report

Microsoft\'s January 2026 Patch Tuesday update (KB5074109) for Windows 11 has caused widespread issues, including black screen glitches, Outlook failures, and broken Azure Virtual Desktop connections.
<!-- more -->

The update, released for versions 24H2 and 25H2, was meant to address security flaws but instead led to desktop freezes, Outlook Classic not launching, and authentication failures for enterprise users. Microsoft responded with emergency out-of-band patches and a Known Issue Rollback, but manual fixes are still required for many. Users are advised to check the Microsoft Update Catalog for the latest emergency updates.
