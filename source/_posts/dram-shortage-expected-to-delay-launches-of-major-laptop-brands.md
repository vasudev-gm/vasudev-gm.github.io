The ongoing RAM shortage has already had knock-on effect on the consumer market, from price hikes to system integrators starting to offer "bring your own RAM" build options and smartphone makers stepping back to offering 8 GB of RAM in flagship devices. However, the latest news suggests that the RAM shortage will soon result in delayed product launches—specifically in the laptop and mobile market, according to a report out of Korean business publication, Chosun Biz.

According to the report, which quoted industry insiders and analysts, large hardware brands, like HP and Lenovo, have recently signed agreements with memory suppliers in an effort to secure RAM for the upcoming product launch cycle. Despite this, insiders are predicting that launch delays are likely as DRAM demand still exceeds supply. The alternative solutions include a price hike, which would be in the order of 30% in the premium segment—on top of an already predicted 9% industry-wide price increase—or downsizing the premium laptop segment. Whether this plays out as predicted will likely be revealed fairly soon, as CES 2026, and all of its expected product launches, is just around the corner.
