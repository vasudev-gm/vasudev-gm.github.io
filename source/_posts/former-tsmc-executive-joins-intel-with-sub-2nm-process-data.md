### Quick Report

Former TSMC Senior VP Wei-Jen Lo has joined Intel as VP of R&D, reportedly bringing knowledge and possibly documents related to TSMC\'s sub-2nm process technologies.

Lo, who retired from TSMC in July after 21 years, allegedly requested internal briefings and copies of documents on 2nm, A16, and A14 nodes before leaving. TSMC is now investigating and has filed a lawsuit in Taiwan, citing trade secrets and a non-compete agreement. The case could have major implications for both companies as Intel ramps up its 18A and 14A nodes, while TSMC prepares for A16 mass production in 2026. Lo\'s move has drawn scrutiny under Taiwan\'s national security laws and highlights the fierce competition in advanced semiconductor R&D.

UPDATE: Taiwan authorities have seized computers, USB drives, and other assets from Wei-Jen Lo, freezing over NT$179.89 billion ($5.76 million USD) including NT$161.90 billion in TSMC stock. Intel denies TSMC\'s allegations and supports Lo.
