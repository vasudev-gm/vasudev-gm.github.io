### Quick Report

Intel\'s next-generation Panther Lake mobile CPUs have leaked, showing flagship Core Ultra X9 388H models with 16 cores (4 P-Cores, 8 E-Cores, 4 LPE-Cores) and turbo boost speeds up to 5.1 GHz. The new lineup, built on the Intel 18A process, brings multiple core configurations and up to 12 Xe3 GPU cores. TDPs range from 25 W to 80 W, depending on OEM settings.<!-- more -->

Panther Lake is positioned as a successor to Lunar Lake for premium laptops, with improved efficiency and a wider range of SKUs. While the 5.1 GHz boost is slightly lower than Arrow Lake\'s peak, architectural improvements are expected to offset the difference. The chips are expected to launch in 2026, targeting high-end mobile and thin-and-light devices.
