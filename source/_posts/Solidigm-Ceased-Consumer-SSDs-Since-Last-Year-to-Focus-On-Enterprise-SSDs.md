### Quick Report

Solidigm, the SSD division of SK Hynix, has ceased consumer SSD operations since last year according to ITHome [def2] thereby ceasing all production of P44 Pro and P41 NVMe SSDs. They have proceeded to remove all product listings from their website.

The decision was made to focus on enterprise SSDs, which is a more profitable market and laid off staff and re-routed remaining staff to focus on enterprise solutions to tackle AI and HPC workloads, a unnamed source tipped off Tom\'s Hardware [def3]. A sad state to see in SSD space where there are less competitions in consumer SSDs.
