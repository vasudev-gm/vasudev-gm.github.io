### Quick Report

Tom Peterson has confirmed that XE3 IP is baked which means media engines, XMX matrix cores, ray tracing engines etc are designed and are awaiting trial fabrication to get pre-validated GPUs for testing and validation before entering mass production, final release drivers and software.

According to a snippet shared by X account [@Haze2K1][def], Intel Xe3 Celestial GPU is nearing tapeout and is expected to be ready for pre-silicon validation which will enable OEMs/vendors to boot and test new chip architecture to catch design issues before chip enters mass production
