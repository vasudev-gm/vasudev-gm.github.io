- Intel recommends users migrate to other Linux distributions for security and stability
- The Clear Linux OS GitHub repository will be archived
- Intel reaffirms commitment to the Linux ecosystem and open-source contributions

If you are currently running Clear Linux OS, it is strongly recommended to migrate to another actively maintained Linux distribution as soon as possible. Without further updates or security patches, continued use of Clear Linux could expose systems to security risks.
