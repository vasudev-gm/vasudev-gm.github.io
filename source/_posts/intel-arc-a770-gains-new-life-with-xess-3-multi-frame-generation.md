### Quick Report

Intel\'s Arc 32.0.101.8509 WHQL driver release has brought XeSS 3 multi-frame generation (MFG) support to older Arc Alchemist GPUs, including the Arc A770. Testing by PC Games Hardware Germany shows the 2022-era flagship enjoying significant performance improvements, particularly with MFG 3x and 4x modes enabled alongside XeLL (low latency function).

While the Arc A770 doesn\'t match NVIDIA\'s GeForce RTX 2000-series in terms of driver maturation, the overnight improvement in usability is substantial. The 16 GB memory buffer ensures no bottlenecks, and the newer Arc B580 scales even better thanks to improved Battlemage hardware architecture. However, XeSS 3 MFG isn\'t universally applicable—only certain titles support the technology. PCGH noted visual discrepancies in Battlefield 6 sessions, where they preferred native frame presentation or competing technologies like FSR 4 and DLSS 4.5.

The driver update represents Intel\'s commitment to supporting older hardware generations, a strategy that contrasts with some competitors\' approach to feature segmentation. Arc Alchemist owners can now access advanced frame generation technology previously reserved for newer Battlemage cards.
