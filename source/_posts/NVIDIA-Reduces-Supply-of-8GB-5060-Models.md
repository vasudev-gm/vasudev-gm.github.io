According to industry sources, NVIDIA is scaling back production of the 8GB variants of the RTX 5060 series. This move comes as the company continues to navigate supply chain challenges and market demand for graphics cards.

The reduction in supply for these entry-level models may be driven by several factors:

- Focus on higher-margin products
- Managing inventory levels
- Responding to market demand shifts
- Preparing for upcoming product launches

This development could impact availability and pricing for budget-conscious gamers and PC builders looking for affordable RTX 5060 series cards. NVIDIA has not officially commented on these supply changes.
