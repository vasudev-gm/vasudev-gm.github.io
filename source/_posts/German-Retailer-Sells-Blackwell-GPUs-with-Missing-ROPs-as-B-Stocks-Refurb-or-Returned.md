### Quick Report

A German retailer has listed RTX 50 series GPU with missing ROPs (Render Output Units) as B-Stocks (Refurb or Returned). Initial reports stated that there were performance deficits with lower ROPs and made it perform worse or equal than Ada GPUs which is the predecessor of Blackwell.

The listing was a Zotac 5090 Solid OC GPU with 168 ROPs instead of advertised 176 ROPs priced at whopping 2899 Euros. It is suggested some retailer did not opt to return the B-Stocks to manufacturers and uncertain how many B-Stocks are in circulation.
