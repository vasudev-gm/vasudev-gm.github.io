### Quick Report

NVIDIA announced a strategic collaboration with Intel that includes a $5 billion purchase of Intel common stock and a multi-generation co-development program to build custom x86 CPUs and x86 RTX SOCs interconnected via NVIDIA NVLink. The partnership aims to tightly integrate NVIDIA\'s AI and accelerated computing technologies with Intel\'s CPU and manufacturing expertise to accelerate AI infrastructure and personal computing products.

Under the agreement, Intel will develop NVIDIA-custom x86 CPUs for data center platforms and x86 system-on-chips (SOCs) that integrate NVIDIA RTX GPU chiplets for personal computing. NVIDIA will invest $5 billion at $23.28 per share in Intel common stock, subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals.

The collaboration centers on NVLink as the interconnect to seamlessly couple CPU and GPU resources, enabling higher-bandwidth, lower-latency communication than traditional PCIe links. For data centers, the joint effort targets NVIDIA-custom x86 CPUs that will be offered as part of NVIDIA's AI infrastructure platforms. For personal computing, the x86 RTX SOCs will combine Intel's CPU capabilities with NVIDIA's GPU chiplets to power a new generation of PCs.

NVIDIA founder and CEO Jensen Huang highlighted the importance of fusing NVIDIA's AI stack with Intel's x86 ecosystem to lay the foundation for the next era of computing. Intel's leadership emphasized process technology, manufacturing, and packaging capabilities as complementary strengths that will accelerate product development.

The investment and collaboration are subject to regulatory approvals (including HSR reviews) and customary closing conditions. A joint CEO press conference and webcast were scheduled to discuss the announcement.
