### Quick Report

Valve has officially ended support for the 32-bit Steam client on Windows 10 and Windows 11, completing its transition to a 64-bit-only application. Updates for the 32-bit client will continue for legacy Windows systems until January 1, 2026, after which only 64-bit versions will be maintained.

This move affects very few users, as nearly all modern PCs and operating systems are 64-bit. Those still on 32-bit Windows will need to upgrade their hardware or OS to continue using Steam officially. Unofficial community backports may exist, but they come with security and compatibility risks. Valve\'s decision streamlines software maintenance and aligns with the broader industry shift away from 32-bit support.
