NVIDIA\'s GPUs are present in 258 out of 359 datacenter locations, making them the backbone of global AI infrastructure. AMD\'s Instinct MI GPUs are found in just 21 locations, but adoption is slowly growing. Custom ASICs now account for 22.3% of the market, driven by hyperscalers\' in-house chips. As demand for AI accelerators grows, the competitive landscape may shift, but NVIDIA\'s lead remains strong.
