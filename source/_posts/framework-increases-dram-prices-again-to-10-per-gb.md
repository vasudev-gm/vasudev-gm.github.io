### Quick Report

Framework has updated its DRAM pricing, now charging $10 per GB for DDR5 memory modules in its laptop configurations, citing continued increases from suppliers and market volatility.

Framework updated its original DRAM price hike blog post on December 24th, 2025, explaining that the company must respond to the price volatility its suppliers are experiencing. Initially, Framework announced a 50% price increase for its DDR5 memory upgrade configurations. To maintain transparency with customers, the company stated its intention to raise the price of DDR5 memory in Framework Laptop DIY Edition orders by 50%. This decision directly responds to the significantly higher costs from DRAM suppliers and distributors. As a result, the company cannot absorb all these cost increases and needs to pass some on to consumers. Therefore, another increase today is a natural response, as the company originally suggested.

With costs from suppliers continuing to increase, Framework has had to make a further price adjustment on DDR5 memory modules. During this period of extreme memory shortages and price volatility, the company\'s priority is to make sure customers can still buy a computer when they need one. With that in mind, Framework is setting its memory configuration prices as close as possible to the actual purchase prices it has with suppliers and distributors. Since the company is constantly sourcing additional memory and each purchase comes in at different (and often higher) pricing, it is using the Weighted Average Cost (WAC) of inventory, which currently comes to $10/GB for 8 GB, 16 GB, and 32 GB modules, and slightly higher for 48 GB modules.
