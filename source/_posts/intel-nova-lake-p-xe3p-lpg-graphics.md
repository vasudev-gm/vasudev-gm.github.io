### Quick Report

Intel has confirmed that its upcoming Nova Lake-P processors will use Xe3P-LPG integrated graphics, along with new IP blocks for media and display processing. Not all Nova Lake SKUs will have the same GPU features—only some mobile variants will support ray tracing.<!-- more -->

Nova Lake-P is set to succeed Panther Lake-H in late 2026 or early 2027, targeting mobile gaming and creator laptops. The segmentation strategy means buyers should check GPU features closely, as not all models will offer the same capabilities.
