The company reports making huge strides thanks to new leadership, High-NA EUV machines and a new strategy. Thanks to this, probable mass production of Samsung Exynos 2600 is in the manufacturing pipeline for S26 models. Taiwanese rumour mills are also reporting that TSMC is also working on 2nm node with yields greater than 70-80% and have started cross facility mass production with price hikes. These price hikes are expected to send loyal TSMC customers to alternative source such as Samsung for cheaper BoM.
