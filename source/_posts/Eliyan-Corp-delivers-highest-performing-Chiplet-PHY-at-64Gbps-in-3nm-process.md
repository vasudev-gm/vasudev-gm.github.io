### Quick Report

Eliyan corp credited for the invention of semiconductor industry's highest performing and most power efficient chiplet PHY at 64Gbps in 3nm process named **NuLink 2.0 PHY**. The device achieved 64Gbps/bump the highest performing die-to-die PHY solution for multi-die architectures. It's compatible with UCIe standard with 2x bandwidth on standard as well as advanced packaging.
