### Quick Report

NZXT has addressed concerns from its infamous H1 PCIe riser cable fire risk by detailing the engineering changes made in the new H2 Flow case. The original H1\'s issue stemmed from a mounting screw contacting a power plane in the riser PCB, causing shorts and potential fires.

For the H2 Flow, NZXT introduced a physical boss to keep screws away from PCB traces and redesigned the PCB so all traces near the screw hole are grounded, with a copper screw pad for extra protection. These changes, missing in some early review units but present in mass production, are meant to eliminate the failure mode and reassure buyers that the problem cannot recur.
