### Quick Report

Hyper announced the HyperSpace Trackpad Pro, a premium haptic trackpad engineered for Microsoft Windows with 240 Hz response, full-force sensing, and deep app-specific profiles. The device launches on Kickstarter with an early-bird price of $90 and a projected SRP of $149.99.

The Trackpad Pro uses third-generation piezo haptics for consistent, click-anywhere feedback across its glass surface and a full-force sensing matrix to detect pressure for richer interactions in creative and productivity apps. Hyper\'s Hydra Connect software provides app-specific profiles and a widget for quick profile switching, with pre-loaded profiles for Adobe and Microsoft apps.

While purpose-built for Windows with full multitouch gesture support, the unit also offers basic compatibility with macOS for navigation and clicks. Hyper says the trackpad targets creators and power users who want a Mac-like trackpad experience on Windows desktops and workstations.
