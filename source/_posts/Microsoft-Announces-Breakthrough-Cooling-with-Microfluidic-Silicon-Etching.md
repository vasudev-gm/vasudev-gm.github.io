### Quick Report

Microsoft has demonstrated an in-chip microfluidic cooling system that etches tiny channels directly into silicon to circulate coolant at the source of heat, removing heat up to three times more effectively than traditional cold plates and reducing peak silicon temperature rise by as much as 65%. The approach, developed with AI-assisted bio-inspired channel design and industrial partners, promises higher power density, better efficiency, and improved sustainability for large-scale AI deployments.

Microsoft tested the microfluidic system in lab-scale server workloads and reported significant cooling gains across configurations. The effort pairs advanced microfabrication with AI-driven thermal mapping to route coolant to hot spots, improving thermal management compared to layered cold-plate solutions that sit above the silicon.

Key technical points:

- Cooling effectiveness: Lab tests showed up to 3x better heat removal than cold plates and a ~65% reduction in maximum silicon temperature rise, depending on workload and configuration.
- Design and tooling: Microchannels are etched at hair-width dimensions; Microsoft collaborated with Swiss startup Corintis and used AI to evolve a bio-inspired channel layout (leaf/vein-like) that improves distribution and avoids clogging.
- Engineering challenges: The team solved for leak-proof packaging, coolant selection, etch depth tolerances, and manufacturing repeatability across multiple design iterations.
- Systems approach: Microsoft emphasizes that microfluidics must be integrated with server, rack, and datacenter systems; the company expects PUE gains and the ability to increase server density without proportionally increasing thermal limits.
- Broader implications: Microfluidics could enable more aggressive chip designs, safer overclocking of servers during peak loads, and even new 3D-stacked chip architectures with internal coolant routing.

Microsoft framed the work as part of a larger investment in infrastructure and in-house silicon (Azure Cobalt family) to meet rising AI demand. The company plans further reliability testing and to work with fabricators and partners to bring microfluidic cooling into production.
