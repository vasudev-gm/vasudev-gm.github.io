### Quick Report

During the recent IFA 2025 event in Berlin, AMD challenged the commonly held belief that ARM processors are inherently more power-efficient than x86 designs. The company argued that both AMD Ryzen and Intel Core processors can deliver competitive battery life in notebooks while maintaining compatibility with the extensive x86 software ecosystem, suggesting that overall system design is more important than instruction set architecture for efficiency.

According to a now-deleted article from ComputerBase cited by TechPowerUp, AMD stated that "**the myth that x86 can\'t be efficient was refuted last year.**" The company pointed to modern x86 designs like Intel\'s "Lunar Lake" and AMD\'s own "**Strix Point**" as examples of processors that deliver significant performance in power-efficient packages.

AMD\'s position reflects a defensive stance from traditional x86 vendors as ARM-based systems gain traction in the PC market. The company acknowledged it had previously evaluated using the ARM ISA with its K12 project but ultimately decided to focus on x86 due to "numerous advantages of software" compatibility.

While ARM has been making inroads into the PC space with products like Qualcomm\'s Snapdragon X and NVIDIA\'s upcoming N1/N1x processors, AMD emphasized that these represent a small portion of the PC market compared to the overwhelming volume of systems running x86 chips. The company specifically pointed to the prevalence of x86 in notebooks and handheld gaming consoles as evidence that the architecture can be power-efficient.

The debate over ISA efficiency has significant implications for the future of computing. ARM-based designs, particularly Apple\'s M-series chips, have demonstrated impressive performance-per-watt metrics. However, AMD\'s argument suggests that the efficiency advantages often attributed to ARM may have more to do with specific implementation choices rather than inherent architectural superiority.

Industry analysts note that this positioning comes as AMD continues to face competitive pressure from both traditional rival Intel and emerging ARM-based solutions. The company\'s statements align with Intel\'s recent messaging, forming a united front for x86 against ARM\'s encroachment into traditional PC markets.

As the computing landscape continues to evolve, the debate over which architecture offers superior efficiency will likely persist, with real-world performance, battery life, and software compatibility remaining the key factors for consumers and manufacturers.
