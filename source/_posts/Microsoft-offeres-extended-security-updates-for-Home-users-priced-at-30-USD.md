### Quick Report

Microsoft has announced that it will offer extended security updates for Windows Home users for a price of 30 USD for a year after EOL. This is a significant change from the previous policy of offering extended security updates as it was earlier limited to Enterprise editions of Windows and LTSC versions.

The move comes as a surprise since Microsoft has stated users upgrade to Windows 11 if their current machines satisfies the minimum requirements such as TPM 2.0, Virtualization Based Security, Secure Boot and more security features or extensions shipped on modern CPUs from Intel, AMD and Qualcomm ARM.

Microsoft will also provide Defender Security Intelligence updates till October 2028 to protect current Windows 10 users who aren't eligible for Windows 11 upgrade since it will open up the door for potential security threats or leave users unprotected.
