NVIDIA has unveiled its latest 5060 series GPUs at Computex 2025, showcasing significant advancements in performance and efficiency with DLSS 4 and AI powered features. The new lineup includes the RTX 5060 & 5060 Ti, all built on the Blackwell architecture featuring on both desktops and laptops.

5060 series comes with 3840 CUDA cores, 8 GB VRAM on 128 bit bus paired with GDDR7 memory priced at 300 USD. The 5060 Ti variant boosts performance with 4608 CUDA cores and 8/16 GB VRAM on a 128 bit bus, priced at 397 and 429 USD for 8 and 16GB models. All models support ray tracing, DLSS 4 MFG and AI features, making them ideal for gamers and content creators.

On personal note, vendor cards will be priced higher than reference models and 8GB in 2025 is a hard sell for 300 USD. The 5060 Ti with 16GB is a better value proposition, especially for those looking to future-proof their systems. The performance improvements over the previous generation are substantial, making these GPUs a compelling choice for both gaming and professional workloads. NVIDIA has announced USD 50,000 for best RTX Remix mod contest, encouraging developers to create innovative mods using the new GPUs.
