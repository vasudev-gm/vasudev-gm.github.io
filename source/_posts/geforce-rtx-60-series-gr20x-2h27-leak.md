### Quick Report

NVIDIA\'s next-generation GeForce RTX 60 series is rumored to be based on mysterious GR20x (Rubin) GPU dies, with a predicted launch window in the second half of 2027. Industry insiders have shifted focus from the RTX 50 SUPER series, which was absent at CES 2026, to these future designs.

The GR20x family, including a possible GR212 model, is expected to power the RTX 60 lineup, marking a significant generational leap. The long gap between launches reflects both industry slowdowns and NVIDIA\'s focus on enterprise and AI markets. Observers speculate that the new series could leverage advanced process nodes and architectural changes, but concrete specs remain under wraps.
