### Quick Report

In a leaked screenshot provided by [Tomasz Gawro≈Ñski][def], the RDNA 4 sample on-par with RX 7900 XTX in a leaked score from Furmark 2. Tomasz said he found a device ID match in Geekbench DB for the same and concluded that it is a RDNA 4 sample.

The score of 7931 is on par with RX 7900 XTX. But, I'm unsure Furmark 2 is a good benchmark for RDNA 4 and would like to see how it performs on AI tasks, Gaming, and other benchmarks such as 3DMark. As this is a rumour leak and we\'ll likely see formal announcement of RDNA 4 cards on February 28th for MSRP and gaming performance with FSR4.
