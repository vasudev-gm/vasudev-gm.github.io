### Quick Report

Intel XeSS 3 with multi-frame generation (MFG) is expected to officially arrive for Arc B580 "Battlemage" GPUs this month, but some users have already enabled it using a simple file swap workaround. By installing the Panther Lake driver package and renaming certain DLLs, gamers can activate XeSS 3 on Arc B580 cards before Intel\'s official support lands.

This unofficial method appears to work without major issues, though some game compatibility problems may arise. Intel\'s delay in official support may be due to marketing or further testing. For now, impatient users have a way to try the new upscaling tech early, but should proceed with caution.
