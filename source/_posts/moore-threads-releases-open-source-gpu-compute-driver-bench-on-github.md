The suite features realistic workloads, multi-dimensional driver evaluation, and automated scoring for regression tracking. It targets performance bottlenecks in task scheduling, memory operations, and resource management. Released under the Apache 2.0 license, this move positions Moore Threads as a serious contender in the GPU compute space, especially as it continues to innovate with domestic architectures.
