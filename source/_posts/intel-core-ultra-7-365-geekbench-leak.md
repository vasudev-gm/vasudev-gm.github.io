### Quick Report

A test sample of Intel\'s upcoming Core Ultra 7 365 \"Panther Lake-H\" mobile processor has surfaced on Geekbench 6.3, posting single-core and multi-core scores of 2451 and 9714, respectively. These results are lower than those of the previous-gen Lunar Lake-H chips, with the new model trailing by 6–11% in both single and multi-core performance.<!-- more -->

The benchmarked chip features an 8-core design (4 Performance + 4 Low Power-Efficiency cores) and was tested in a Lenovo prototype with 64 GB RAM. The underwhelming results may be due to pre-release drivers or early silicon, but they raise questions about generational progress for Intel\'s mobile CPUs.
