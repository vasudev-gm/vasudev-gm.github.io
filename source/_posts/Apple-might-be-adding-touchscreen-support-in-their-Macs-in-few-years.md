## Report

Apple has been always hesitant about adding touch support to their Mac lineup so as not to cannibalize their iPad sales has now planned to add touchscreen in the next few years.<!-- more -->

The drastic move could be due to declining iPad sales each quarter and it wants to focus on long term goals which could change the future of iPad in the coming years

Bloomberg\'s Mark Gurman, pointed out in his newsletter "Power ON" that Apple\'s goal is create better differentiation between Mac and their iPad lineups.

Excerpt from Mark Gurman:

> Apple does plan to add OLED and touch-screen support to Macs in the next few years. But it seems more committed to distinguishing its tablets and computers from one another than serving customers who want something more.

With current M4 based iPad Pro costing as much as their Macbook Pros and main bottleneck being iPadOS. It uncertain if Apple will once again unify their Operating System since their Apple Silicon migration is very successful and [Windows/Linux is embracing ARM][def].
