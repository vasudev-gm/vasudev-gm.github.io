### Quick Report

Microsoft addressed the privacy concerns of the recall feature on Copilot+ with a revamp. The feature requires Device Encryption, TPM 2.0, Kernel DMA protection, Virtualization based Code Integrity, Secure Boot and Bitlocker to view/record with the option to disable the feature if user's feels unsafe.

Recall will be a Opt-In feature and users can disable it during Windows installation. By default, it will be disabled unless the user enables it. In addition, Recall needs Windows Hello based Authentication Face or Biometrics and on-device is encrypted unlike the previous version which had stored data in plain text raising security concerns.
Microsoft confirmed it will not capture Private browsing, passwords, or other sensitive information with the help of Purview Privacy toolset technology developed by Microsoft.
