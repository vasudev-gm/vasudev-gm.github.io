Cinebench 2026 leverages the latest Redshift engine, offering more accurate real-world 3D rendering benchmarks. It adds compatibility with NVIDIA Blackwell (5000 series) and AMD 9000 series GPUs on Windows, as well as Apple M4 and M5 systems. A new test evaluates SMT-enabled CPU cores, letting users directly compare SMT and single-threaded performance. Cinebench 2026 scores are not comparable to previous versions due to updated scoring and rendering methods. The tool is available free from Maxon and supports Windows x86-64, Windows ARM64, and macOS.
