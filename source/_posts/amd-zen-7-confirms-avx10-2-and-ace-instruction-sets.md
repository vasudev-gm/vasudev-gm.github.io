### Quick Report

AMD has officially confirmed that Zen 7 CPUs will support the AVX10.2 and ACE instruction sets. AVX10.2 unifies AVX-512 and AVX2 features, boosting performance and compatibility for vector math-heavy workloads. ACE (Advanced Matrix Extensions) brings industry-standard matrix math instructions, making Zen 7 more relevant for AI and machine learning tasks across everything from smartphones to servers.

Zen 7 will also introduce FRED (flexible return and event delivery) to reduce system-level latency, and ChkTag x86 memory tagging to counter memory vulnerabilities like buffer overflows. These additions position Zen 7 as a major step forward for both AI and security, keeping AMD competitive with Intel\'s latest architectures.
