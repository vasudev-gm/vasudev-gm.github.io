### Quick Report

Micron has announced its new 24 Gbit GDDR7 memory chips, offering up to 36 Gbps bandwidth and enabling graphics cards with as much as 96 GB of VRAM. The chips promise improved efficiency, though Micron has not detailed what this means in practice. Samsung previously sampled similar 3 GB GDDR7 chips at the same speed, so Micron\'s offering matches the industry leaders.
