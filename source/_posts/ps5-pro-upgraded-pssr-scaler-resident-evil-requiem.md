### Quick Report

Sony has rolled out the upgraded PSSR (PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution) scaler for the PS5 Pro, debuting in Resident Evil Requiem. The new scaler uses a revised neural network and algorithm, improving image quality and handling intricate textures like hair and fine details. Over 50 games that previously implemented PSSR will gain access to the enhanced model via a March system update, allowing players to enable "Enhance PSSR Image Quality" for older titles.

Capcom\'s RE Engine update for Resident Evil Requiem leverages the new scaler to render individual hair and beard strands as polygons, boosting realism and immersion. Sony aims to deliver unprecedented visual fidelity and gameplay feel, with more games expected to support the upgraded PSSR soon.
