### Quick Report

AMD is reportedly shifting its production strategy to focus on the Radeon RX 9070 XT, reducing output of the non-XT version. Both cards use the Navi 48 die and 16 GB GDDR6 memory, but the XT model offers a better profit margin due to its higher MSRP and similar production costs.

The non-XT version will not be discontinued, but AMD is allocating more capacity to the XT variant. This move is intended to minimize price corrections as memory costs rise. AMD is also working with AIC partners to stabilize memory pricing and ensure steady supply, though some price fluctuations may persist.
