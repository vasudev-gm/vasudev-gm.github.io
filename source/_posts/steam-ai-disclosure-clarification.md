### Quick Report

Valve has updated its Steam AI disclosure policy to clarify that developers only need to declare AI-generated content that is directly consumed by players, such as in-game assets, narrative, and marketing materials. The use of AI-powered dev tools for efficiency does not require disclosure.
<!-- more -->

The revised guidelines specify that only content generated by AI and visible to players or used in marketing must be disclosed. Developers remain responsible for any AI-generated content in their games or on their Steam Store pages. The policy aims to address copyright and safety concerns while exempting internal development tool usage from public disclosure.
