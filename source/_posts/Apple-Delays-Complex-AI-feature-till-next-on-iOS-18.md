## Report

Apple has always lagged behind the competition when it comes to AI based features in their devices. While competitors like Google, OpenAI, Microsoft, NVIDIA etc has started pushing more AI powered experiences both on-device, cloud and at-scale compute servers for faster training and inference.<!-- more -->

However Apple has decided to start adding few AI powered experiences with iOS 18 with upcoming WWDC event. As per [Mark Gurman][def], advanced AI features for Siri will not be completed until 2025.

Still, the report does not mention exactly which features are delayed but high confidence is given Siri AI functions for both on-device and cloud. There are reports of a deal with OpenAI and possible talks with Alphabet or Google for its Gemini AI with the possibility of third-party Digital Assistant through a new API or interface designed by Apple.

Also, Apple has bumped the specs for running their Generative-AI based experiences for [iOS 18][def2] limited to iPhone 15 Pro/Pro Max and higher variants due to better NPU for best-in-class on-device AI performance mixed with cloud AI experiences for complex AI tasks.
