### Quick Report

Intel says its roadmap will not change following Nvidia\'s strategic investment and agreement to supply RTX graphics chiplets. The company confirmed ARC GPUs remain in development, and Nvidia\'s chiplets are expected to be complementary additions rather than replacements for Intel\'s existing GPU plans.

Intel told reporters the collaboration with Nvidia is **complementary to Intel\'s roadmap** and that it will "continue to have GPU product offerings." Public roadmaps such as Panther Lake and Nova Lake are expected to remain on schedule, with Nvidia\'s RTX chiplets likely to be added as premium or optional configurations for certain markets (gaming, creators, and business).

The partnership could add high-end, modular GPU options to Intel\'s lineup, potentially in the form of RTX chiplets attached to CPU packages. However, PCWorld notes that Intel\'s own ARC discrete and integrated GPU efforts are still active and that the company appears committed to maintaining its GPU product roadmap.

Analysts and reporters remain cautious: while Intel\'s statements emphasize continuity, the long-term impact on ARC\'s competitive positioning is uncertain. The collaboration is expected to be additive: Intel\'s mainstream and integrated GPU strategy continues, with Nvidia\'s chiplets offering additional premium choices.
