### Quick Report

Last Week Synology issued an updated press release in EU stating they will be locking out owners of Plus Series NAS against using Non-Synology HDD/SSDs to ensure better reliability and performance.

<!-- more -->
Owners were not happy with features being restricted since Synology uses re-branded HDDs from Seagate or WD or Toshiba since they don\'t have their own HDDs. The changes will apply to entry level with 4 bay NAS drives and upwards. The entrypoint for NAS was retiring old servers and re-use existing drives as NAS drives to access user data such as local streaming of video or images or even backup.

Chad Chiang, Managing Director of Synology GmbH and Synology UK defended the move by stating this was to ensure better reliability and performance in various deployment scenarios for tighter integration of validated hardware and software benefiting small home to large business organizations.
