### Quick Report

NVIDIA has reinstated 32-bit PhysX support for its RTX 50 series GPUs as part of the latest Game Ready driver rollout. The update includes support for nine titles in the initial release, restoring compatibility for older PhysX-enabled games.<!-- more -->

PhysX is NVIDIA\'s physics simulation technology used in many games for realistic effects like debris, cloth, and fluid dynamics. While newer games use 64-bit PhysX, many older titles still rely on 32-bit implementations. The reinstatement ensures RTX 50 series owners can enjoy legacy PhysX games without compatibility issues. This move demonstrates NVIDIA\'s commitment to maintaining backward compatibility even as it pushes forward with cutting-edge GPU technology.
