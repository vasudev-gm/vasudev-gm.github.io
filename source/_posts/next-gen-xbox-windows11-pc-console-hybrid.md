The console will use AMD\'s **Magnus** SoC, featuring up to 11 CPU cores (Zen 6/Zen 6c), 68 RDNA 5 compute units, 48GB GDDR7, and a dedicated NPU for on-device AI. This marks a shift from the traditional walled-garden console model, offering flexibility and performance for both gaming and productivity. Multiple devices at different price points are planned, with a first-party handheld still under consideration.
