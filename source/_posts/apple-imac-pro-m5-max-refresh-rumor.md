### Quick Report

Apple is rumored to be working on a refreshed iMac Pro, but leaks suggest it will feature the M5 Max chip rather than the flagship M5 Ultra SoC. The new model, identified as J833c, is expected to offer a 16-core CPU and 40-core GPU, a big leap from the current iMac\'s M4.

The iMac Pro may also see the return of a 27-inch display with improved brightness and HDR, targeting creative professionals. While the M5 Pro, Max, and Ultra chips are due in Spring 2026, the iMac Pro will likely launch with the M5 Max, leaving the Ultra for other high-end desktops.
