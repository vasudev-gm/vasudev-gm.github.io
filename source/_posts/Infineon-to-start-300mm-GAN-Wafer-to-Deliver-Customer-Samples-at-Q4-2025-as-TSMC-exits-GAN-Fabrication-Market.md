### Quick Report

Infineon Technologies AG has announced that its 300-millimeter gallium nitride (GaN) wafer manufacturing process is on track, with first customer samples expected in the fourth quarter of 2025. This development comes at a strategic time as industry sources report that TSMC is planning to exit the GaN fabrication market, potentially leaving a significant gap in the industry that Infineon is well-positioned to fill.

- **Infineon\'s GaN Milestone**: The company has become the first semiconductor manufacturer to successfully develop 300-millimeter GaN power wafer technology within its existing high-volume manufacturing infrastructure
- **Efficiency Gains**: The larger 300mm wafer diameter allows 2.3 times more chips to be produced per wafer compared to traditional 200mm wafers
- **Market Timing**: First customer samples will be available in Q4 2025, with full production scale-up to follow
- **TSMC\'s Exit**: According to industry sources, TSMC plans to exit the GaN fabrication market, potentially strengthening Infineon\'s position
- **Growing Market**: Analysts expect the GaN revenue for power applications to grow by 36% annually to approximately $2.5 billion by 2030

GaN power semiconductors are being rapidly adopted across multiple sectors due to their higher power density, faster switching speeds, and lower power losses. Key application areas include:

- Power supplies for AI data centers
- Solar inverters for renewable energy
- Chargers and adapters for consumer electronics
- Motor control systems for industrial automation
- Electric vehicle charging infrastructure
- Humanoid robots requiring high-efficiency power electronics

Market analysts from Yole Group expect the GaN revenue for power applications to grow by 36 percent annually, reaching approximately US $2.5 billion by 2030.
