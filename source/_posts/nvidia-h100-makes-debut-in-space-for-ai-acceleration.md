### Quick Report

NVIDIA\'s **H100 Hopper** GPU has made its cosmic debut aboard a Starcloud satellite, becoming the first AI accelerator in space. The 60kg package provides over 100x more compute capacity than existing space infrastructure and uses radiative cooling to reject heat into the vacuum of space.

The satellite-mounted AI module represents a significant leap in extraterrestrial computing power. Unlike Earth-based systems that rely on convective cooling, the space-based H100 uses radiators to emit infrared radiation into deep space for thermal management. When oriented away from direct solar irradiation, the system can maintain lower operating temperatures than Earth-based equivalents.

Starcloud plans to launch this pioneering satellite in November 2025, with ambitious future goals including a 5GW space data center powered by 16 square kilometers of solar panels. NVIDIA envisions applications in Earth observation, crop identification, weather prediction, wildfire detection, and distress signal response, enabling near-instantaneous data processing directly in space.

The breakthrough addresses power and cooling challenges through space\'s unique environmentâ€”unlimited solar energy and the natural heat sink of the vacuum. However, the design still requires careful engineering to balance thermal interfaces, radiator area, emissivity, and heat flow management.
