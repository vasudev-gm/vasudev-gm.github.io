### Quick Report

Apple is reportedly considering Chinese memory makers CXMT and YMTC as new suppliers for DRAM and NAND storage in upcoming iPhone 18 and Mac products. This move comes as traditional suppliers like Samsung and SK hynix raise prices amid a global memory shortage, squeezing Apple’s margins.

The US government recently removed CXMT and YMTC from its restricted entity list, clearing the way for Apple to diversify its supply chain. CXMT\'s LPDDR5X and DDR5 memory, along with YMTC\'s advanced 3D NAND chips, could help Apple reduce reliance on South Korean and Japanese vendors. YMTC\'s latest 3D NAND features 294 layers and competitive bit density, matching industry leaders. If adopted, these Chinese components could reshape the global memory and storage market.
