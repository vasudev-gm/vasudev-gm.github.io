### Quick Report

NVIDIA\'s next DLSS update, DLSS 4.5, is reported to introduce a 2nd‑generation transformer-based model alongside dynamic frame generation that can scale up to 6×. The goal is to boost performance while maintaining or improving image quality, with the system adjusting frame synthesis aggressiveness in real time based on scene complexity and motion.

According to reporting, DLSS 4.5\'s new model targets better reconstruction fidelity in difficult content (fine foliage, sub‑pixel detail, transparencies), while the dynamic 6× frame generation aims to minimize artifacts during rapid camera movement by modulating insertion cadence. NVIDIA Reflex remains a key companion for keeping end‑to‑end latency in check.
