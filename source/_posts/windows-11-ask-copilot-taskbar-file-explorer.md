### Quick Report

Microsoft demonstrated a deeper AI integration path for Windows 11 with an optional "Ask Copilot" interface that can replace standard Windows Search. Users can summon specific agents from the taskbar by typing the "@" symbol, while long-running tasks can continue in the background with progress indicators shown directly in the taskbar.<!-- more -->

The update also introduces a Copilot button inside File Explorer to provide summaries and context for synced shared documents without opening a separate app. Microsoft says the goal is to embed small AI helpers across daily Windows workflows, and the company expects the rollout to reach users in the coming weeks.
