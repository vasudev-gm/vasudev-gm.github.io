### Quick Report

AMD has announced the Kintex UltraScale+ Gen 2 FPGA family, aiming to capture the middle of the market with a focus on industrial automation, medical imaging, and broadcast video production. The new Gen 2 series modernizes the 16 nm Kintex platform, introducing support for LPDDR4X, DDR5, and LPDDR5X memory, as well as PCIe Gen 4 and dual 100G Ethernet MACs.

Unlike competitors moving to newer nodes, AMD retains the 16 nm process for platform stability and supply assurance, while upgrading I/O and logic capabilities. Security is enhanced with CNSA 2.0-grade cryptography and anti-cloning features. AMD commits to supporting the series until 2045, appealing to industries with long product lifecycles. Engineering samples are expected in Q4 2026, with mass production in the first half of 2027.
