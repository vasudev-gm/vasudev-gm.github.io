### Quick Report

Intel is mandating that OEMs use LPDDR5X memory running at 7,467 MT/s or faster in laptops with Panther Lake Arc B390 and B370 integrated graphics. Systems with slower memory will only show generic "Intel Graphics" branding, while those meeting the spec get full Arc branding in Windows 11.

This move aims to prevent OEMs from cutting corners and ensures the iGPU has enough bandwidth for strong performance. Flagship Panther Lake chips can support up to 9,600 MT/s, and a separate, more efficient B380 SKU is expected for handhelds. The requirement should help maintain consistent graphics performance across devices.
