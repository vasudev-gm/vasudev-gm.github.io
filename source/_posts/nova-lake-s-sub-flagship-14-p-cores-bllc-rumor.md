### Quick Report

A fresh round of Nova Lake-S speculation suggests Intel\'s second-best unlocked desktop SKU with big last level cache (bLLC) could ship with fewer performance cores than earlier theorized. The updated configuration described by a leaker points to two compute tiles with seven performance cores each, resulting in 14 P-cores overall, while still pairing with a large bLLC pool.<!-- more -->

TechPowerUp summarizes the rumored stack as a set of \"Core Ultra 400K\"-class parts, with the top configurations allegedly using dual compute tiles and up to 288
MB bLLC. The specific adjustment called out is a move from an 8+12 tile layout to a 7+12 tile layout for the sub-flagship dual-tile part, while the flagship is still described as two 8+16 tiles.

If accurate, this would be an interesting trade: keeping the large cache feature while slightly trimming peak P-core throughput versus the absolute top-end design. As always with early leaks, the naming, core counts, and cache tiers can change before silicon and retail SKUs are finalized.
