### Quick Report

Khronos has released Vulkan 1.4 APIs which is a developer driven update to provide stable cross platform compute and graphics APIs aligning with our roadmap which has finally come into fruition said Tom Olson former Vulkan Working Group Chair as he is stepping down.

Vulkan 1.4 includes the following new features:

- 8K resolution support
- Streaming transfers which can handle large volume of data and render it at full resolution on any platform.
- Optional extensions have been mandated to improve reliability and performance
- Maintenance extensions VK_KHR_maintenance6 are part of Vulkan 1.4 spec

Major hardware vendors including AMD, Arm, Imagination, Intel, NVIDIA, Qualcomm, and Samsung have achieved Vulkan 1.4 conformance through their drivers by passing the comprehensive open-source Vulkan Conformance Test Suite (CTS) containing nearly 3 million tests, while Mesa's open-source Linux drivers have also demonstrated conformance across multiple platforms. Finally, the Vulkan SDK will be updated to include support for version 1.4 in January 2025.
