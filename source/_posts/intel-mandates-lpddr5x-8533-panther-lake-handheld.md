### Quick Report

Intel is mandating LPDDR5X-8533 memory for its upcoming Core Ultra G3 "Panther Lake" chips targeting handheld gaming devices. This move aims to prevent OEMs from using slower memory, ensuring stable performance and maximizing the potential of the Arc integrated graphics.

The G3 series will feature a 14-core CPU (2 P-Cores, 8 E-Cores, 4 LPE-Cores) and Arc graphics, with the G3 Extreme offering 12 Xe3 cores at 2.3 GHz and the standard G3 providing 10 Xe3 cores at 2.2 GHz. Fast memory is crucial as these SoCs are bandwidth-bound, and the new mandate helps offset power envelope limitations in handhelds. Expect the G3 Extreme to deliver near-flagship gaming performance, while the regular G3 offers lower TDP and slightly reduced GPU specs.
