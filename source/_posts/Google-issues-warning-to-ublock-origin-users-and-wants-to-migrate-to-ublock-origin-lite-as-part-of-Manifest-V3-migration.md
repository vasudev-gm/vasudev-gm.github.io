### Quick Report

Google is now issuing warnings to users of ublock origin and wants to migrate to ublock origin lite as part of Manifest V3 migration and deprecation of Manifest V2 APIs on October 9 2024 for better privacy and best practices.
<!-- more -->

Users of ublock origin can now migrate to Manifest V3 based ublock origin lite to keep ads and ensure privacy. There is a huge impact on filter rules with Manifest V3 which can effectively reduce the capabilities of ad blocking extensions or addons and many even were opposed to the idea of Manifest V3.

Users can switch to uBO lite or even use Firefox which allows Manifest V2 extension APIs to continue using ublock origin with their custom lists and more filtering.
