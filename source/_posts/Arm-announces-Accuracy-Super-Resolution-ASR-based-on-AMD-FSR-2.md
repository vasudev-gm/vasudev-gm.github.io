### Quick Report

In a community blog post, ARM announced Accuracy Super Resolution (ASR), an open source solution for upscaling games on mobile devices based on [AMD FSR 2][def]. The solution works similar to FSR 2 by accepting a lower input resolution and upscaling in real time to a higher output resolution for improved frame rates and power efficient mobile devices to enhance battery life and thermals.

ARM collaborated with Mediatek to test power consumption in specific workloads which brought up to 40% power savings. At the moment, ARM only shared a tech demo of ASR and will be available for developers in the coming months.
