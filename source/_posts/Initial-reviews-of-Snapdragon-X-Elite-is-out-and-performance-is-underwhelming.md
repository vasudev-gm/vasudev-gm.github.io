## Quick Report

Initial reviews of the Snapdragon X Elite are out and the performance is underwhelming. The new chip from Qualcomm was highly anticipated, but it seems to have fallen short of expectations. The Snapdragon X Elite was supposed to be a game-changer for the mobile industry, but it seems to have missed the mark.

Notebook Check received a review unit sent by Asus. CPU performance in ARM native applications are comparable to existing x86 designs from Intel and AMD. However, X Elite fell short on gaming performance claims. Battery runtime is also comparable to existing x86 designs. Thermal emissions and noise levels were higher than AMD and Intel.

I will add more details as they come in.
