### Quick Report

Microsoft has confirmed a serious issue with the Windows 11 25H2 October 2025 update (KB5066835) that renders the Windows Recovery Environment (WinRE) completely unusable. The update breaks mouse and keyboard functionality within WinRE, preventing users from accessing critical repair tools when their system encounters problems. This comes just days after Windows 10\'s end of life and follows a series of problematic Windows 11 updates, including a recent localhost connectivity bug.

The October update KB5066835 for Windows 11 25H2 has introduced a critical flaw that disables USB keyboard and mouse input in the Windows Recovery Environment. WinRE is a built-in troubleshooting toolkit designed to help users recover from system failures, boot problems, or perform repairs when Windows won\'t start normally. With input devices non-functional, users cannot navigate menus, select repair options, or execute any recovery operations.

Microsoft has acknowledged the issue, stating that "the USB keyboard and mouse continue to work normally within the Windows operating system" itself, confirming the problem is isolated to WinRE. The company has assured users they are "working to release a solution to resolve this issue in the coming days" and will provide updates through their Windows 11 version 25H2 known issues [tracking website][def].

This bug affects both fresh Windows 11 25H2 installations and systems that upgraded from 24H2. The issue appears to stem from the same October update that previously broke localhost connectivity, forcing developers to roll back their installations. Windows 11 has been plagued by a growing list of update problems, including:

- **Localhost connectivity issues**: Broke local development environments for developers
- **Online account bypass blocks**: Made clean installations require Microsoft accounts
- **SSD failure risks**: Earlier 24H2 updates caused failures on some Phison-based SSDs
- **Windows Media Creation Tool breakage**: Accidentally disabled just before Windows 10\'s end of life

The timing is particularly troublesome, as Windows 10 officially reached end of life on October 14, 2025, pushing millions of users toward Windows 11. Many enterprise and advanced users rely on WinRE for disaster recovery, system imaging, command-line repairs, and troubleshooting scenarios that don\'t require full OS reinstallation.

Temporary Workarounds:

Until Microsoft releases an official patch, users who need WinRE functionality have limited options. According to sources, the primary workaround involves:

1. Obtaining an older Windows 11 ISO from before the October update
2. Extracting the WinRE.wim file from the older ISO
3. Manually replacing the broken WinRE.wim in the recovery partition

This process requires technical expertise and command-line operations, putting it beyond the reach of most average users. For now, the best approach is to ensure your system remains stable and avoid situations that would require WinRE access.

Microsoft\'s quality control issues with Windows 11 updates continue to erode user confidence. The company once maintained extensive internal testing teams, but cost-cutting measures under CEO Satya Nadella have reduced QA resources. Many experienced developers have been replaced with short-term contractors, and the Windows Insider program increasingly serves as the de facto testing ground for features that reach general availability with known issues.

The WinRE bug represents more than just an inconvenienceâ€”it\'s a safety net failure. Recovery environments exist specifically for emergencies, and having them break due to routine updates undermines the entire purpose of automatic patching. Users who encounter serious Windows problems in the coming days may find themselves forced into clean reinstalls rather than targeted repairs.
