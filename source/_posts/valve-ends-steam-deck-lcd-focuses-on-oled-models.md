### Quick Report

Valve has officially discontinued the Steam Deck LCD 256 GB model, marking a shift in its handheld gaming lineup. Only the 512 GB and 1 TB OLED versions will remain in production and sale. The LCD model, previously priced at $399, is now out of stock on Valve\'s website, and remaining units can only be found through third-party retailers.

The OLED Steam Decks, starting at $549, bring significant upgrades: HDR support, a 90 Hz refresh rate, longer battery life, and larger storage. Valve\'s decision is partly driven by a global NAND flash shortage, with available chips redirected to higher-margin OLED models and the upcoming Steam Machine. This move effectively raises the entry price for new buyers, but most early adopters likely already own the LCD version. The market\'s response to this change remains to be seen as competition in handheld gaming intensifies.
