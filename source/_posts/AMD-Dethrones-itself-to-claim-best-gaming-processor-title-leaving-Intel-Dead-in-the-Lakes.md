### Quick Report

AMD released V-Cache versions of Zen 5 CPUs and started selling on 7 Nov 2024 at USD 480 available in Online Stores, Microcenter etc. Zen 5 non-V-Cache CPUs were not seeing huge demand and release was underwhelming due to massive issues with claimed Zen 5 IPC until Microsoft addressed the issue with Windows 11 23H2 and 24H2 with patch that improved performance massively for some games and apps.

AMD Ryzen 9800X3D has successfully dethroned 7800X3D with 10-40% performance lead in some games thanks to restructured design of by making CCD stack on top of V-Cache or L3D cache as opposed to earlier X3D variants where L3D cache was below CCD stack which limited overclocking and boost clocks capabilities.
