### Quick Report

At Hot Chips 2025, NVIDIA presented its vision for neural rendering as the future of graphics technology, powered by its Blackwell architecture. The presentation focused on how machine learning techniques are being leveraged to overcome traditional rendering limitations and push beyond the **uncanny valley** in computer graphics. NVIDIA\'s Blackwell architecture incorporates dedicated hardware for AI acceleration, including significant support for FP4 precision that doubles efficiency compared to previous solutions. The company positioned its RTX 5090 GPU as the spearhead of this new approach, combining traditional graphics horsepower with neural network capabilities to revolutionize real-time rendering.

NVIDIA\'s presentation at Hot Chips 2025 positioned neural rendering as a transformative approach to computer graphics, moving beyond the constraints of traditional rasterization and ray tracing. According to NVIDIA, overcoming the "uncanny valley" in computer-generated imagery would require prohibitive computational resources using conventional rendering techniques. However, machine learning approaches offer a shortcut to this goal, potentially achieving photorealistic results with significantly less raw computing power.

The Blackwell architecture powering the RTX 5090 and other GPUs in this generation has been specifically designed to excel at neural rendering workloads. Key architectural features highlighted in the presentation include:

1. **FP4 Precision Support**: NVIDIA is betting heavily on FP4 (4-bit floating point) operations for machine learning computations. According to their presentation, FP4 offers sufficient accuracy for graphics-related neural networks while consuming half the memory and computational resources compared to 8-bit alternatives. NVIDIA noted that FP4\'s wider dynamic range compared to INT4 provides additional benefits for neural rendering applications.

2. **AI Management Processor**: A dedicated processor that orchestrates AI workloads alongside traditional graphics tasks, helping to minimize expensive context switches and ensure optimal performance when interleaving different types of computations.

3. **Shader Execution Reordering**: Enhanced capabilities to dynamically reorder shader operations, keeping the streaming multiprocessors (SMs) filled and avoiding processing bubbles. This requires significant integer computation, which was a focus area for performance improvements in the Blackwell generation.

4. **GDDR7 Memory**: The RTX 5090 incorporates GDDR7 memory, which uses PAM3 encoding instead of the PAM4 used in GDDR6X. While this provides fewer bits per clock, the higher signal-to-noise ratio enables much higher clock speeds, resulting in substantially greater memory bandwidth while operating at lower voltages.

NVIDIA demonstrated several practical applications of neural rendering technology during its presentation:

1. **Power Efficiency**: By using frame generation techniques to interpolate frames rather than rendering them conventionally, power consumption can be reduced by up to 50%. This "race to idle" approach delivers comparable visual quality while significantly reducing energy usage.

2. **AI Workload Streaming**: The presentation highlighted how different AI tasks can be efficiently scheduled alongside graphics rendering, with the AI Management Processor ensuring that workloads with different latency requirements don\'t interfere with each other.

3. **Real-time Interaction with AI Agents**: NVIDIA emphasized reducing "time to first token" for AI agents in games, allowing more responsive interaction with ML-powered NPCs and environmental elements without disrupting frame rates.

4. **Universal MIG**: For the first time, NVIDIA is bringing Multi-Instance GPU (MIG) capabilities to consumer GPUs, allowing more efficient resource allocation for cloud gaming and virtualization scenarios. Compared to conventional time slicing, NVIDIA claims MIG delivers up to 60% better performance by keeping GPU resources saturated with parallel workloads.

NVIDIA\'s push toward neural rendering represents more than just a technical evolution; it signals a potential shift in how games and other graphical applications are developed. Developers may increasingly rely on hybrid approaches that combine traditional assets with AI-generated content, potentially reducing production costs for high-fidelity visual experiences.

Neural rendering represents NVIDIA\'s latest attempt to leverage AI as a competitive advantage across all market segments. By unifying their approach across data center, professional, and consumer products, they create economies of scale in both hardware development and software ecosystem building. If successful, this approach could further entrench NVIDIA\'s position in the GPU market, making it increasingly difficult for competitors to challenge them without comparable AI capabilities.
