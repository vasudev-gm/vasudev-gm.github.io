### Quick Report

Ryzen 9800 3D V-Cache is rumoured to be launching soon during Q4 2024 and uplift the bad underwhelming Ryzen 9000 desktop reception due to lackluster performance compared to 7000 3D V-Cache and X series. Since then AMD has been working with Microsoft to improve the Zen 5 and even backport branch prediction update that improved performance of Zen 3, Zen 4 and Zen 5.
