### Quick Report

Microsoft has officially confirmed [plans to retire control panel][def] in favor of Settings app for modern and streamlined experience. The news might come as a shock to some but they were already adding more features to settings app in every Windows 10 and 11 released every year.

Settings app was introduced first on Windows 8 and was also present in their mobile version natively. Whilst, Microsoft did not announced a exact timeline for complete removal and encouraging users to use Settings app since Control Panel solely exists for compatibility reasons.

So, they have urged the longevity is due to two factors mainly backward compatibility with legacy apps and missing features in Settings app.
