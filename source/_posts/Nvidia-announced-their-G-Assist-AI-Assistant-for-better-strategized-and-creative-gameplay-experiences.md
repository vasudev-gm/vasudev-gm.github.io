## Report

NVIDIA today announced new RTX technology to power AI assistants running on new GeForce RTX AI laptops.<!-- more --> Dubbed project [G-Assist][def], an RTX powered AI Assistant that provides context aware help for PC games and apps.

From NVIDIA statement:
> Project G-Assist takes voice or text inputs from the player, along with a snapshot of what’s in the game window. The snapshot is fed into AI vision models that provide context awareness and app-specific understanding for the Large Language Model (LLM), which is connected to a database of game knowledge such as a wiki. The output of the LLM is an insightful and personalized response—either text, or speech from the AI —based on what’s happening in-game.

To demonstrate the AI Assistant, NVIDIA partnered with [Studio Wildcard\'s][def2] [ARK: Survival Ascended][def3] to provide better gaming experiences right from the start. The assistant can be activated through keyboard shortcut or via hotword or wake phrase through voice or keyboard or touch to bring up chatbot which is context aware using on-screen contents and your prompts to craft new items, suggest if the enemy needs to be avoided or defeated for better EXP to help gamers conquer high level areas and foes with the power of AI.
