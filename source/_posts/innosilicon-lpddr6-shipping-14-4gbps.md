### Quick Report

Innosilicon has begun shipping its LPDDR6 memory modules, delivering speeds of 14.4 Gbps well above Samsung\'s initial 10.7 Gbps LPDDR6. This marks a 1.5x increase over previous LPDDR5X offerings and doubles single-channel bandwidth, thanks to a jump from 8 to 12 bits per byte of IO.

The company is collaborating with TSMC and Samsung to ensure sufficient manufacturing capacity for LPDDR6 IP. This move positions Innosilicon ahead of competitors like Samsung, SK Hynix, and Micron, who are still ramping up their LPDDR6 solutions. The JEDEC specification for LPDDR6 sets 14.4 Gbps as the maximum per pin, and Innosilicon is among the first to reach this milestone. The industry will be watching which IP customers adopt as off-the-shelf modules become more widely available.
