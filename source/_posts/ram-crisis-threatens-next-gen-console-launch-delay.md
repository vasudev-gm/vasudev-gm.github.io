### Quick Report

The global RAM shortage is now threatening to delay the launch of next-generation Xbox and PlayStation consoles, with hardware makers considering postponement until memory prices and supply stabilize.<!-- more -->

Originally, the next-gen Xbox and PlayStation were expected to launch in 2027 or 2028, but ongoing DRAM and NAND shortages have forced Microsoft and Sony to reconsider their timelines. Manufacturers like Samsung are shifting NAND production to DRAM, but supply chain expansion will take time. The shortage has already led to slimmer margins and potential price hikes for consoles, with no new launch window announced yet.
